“All the measures we are undertaking will ensure a safe Games regardless of whether there is a state of emergency or not,” John Coates, an IOC vice-president who is in charge of preparations, told reporters after a virtual meeting with organisers on Friday.

“Provided that we can protect the Japanese public, the most important thing is giving athletes a chance to compete.”

The IOC and Tokyo 2020 organisers have insisted the Games will go ahead, despite widespread public opposition in Japan and warnings from health experts that the arrival of tens of thousands of athletes, officials, journalists and support staff this summer risked spreading Covid-19.

Japanese doctors and medical workers have called for the Games to be cancelled to relieve pressure on overwhelmed health services, while a recent poll found that 83 per cent of the public want the event to be either called off or postponed for a second time.

While most athletes are expected to be fully vaccinated by the time the Games open in two months’ time, only 4.1 per cent of Japan’s population has received at least one jab – the lowest rate of any advanced economy – and only 30 per cent of medical workers in Tokyo are fully protected, the Nikkei business newspaper said.

Seiko Hashimoto, the president of Tokyo 2020, said up to 230 doctors and 310 nurses would be needed each day during the Olympics and the Paralympics. The number of officials, journalists and other Games-related staff due to arrive in Tokyo has been cut from 180,000 to 78,000, she added.

“I can say it’s now clearer than ever that these Games would be safe for everyone participating and, importantly, safe for the people of Japan,” Coates said, adding that the IOC was working with organisers to send medical personnel to Tokyo. “After eight years of hard work and planning, the finish line is within touching distance.”

Tokyo and nine other prefectures in Japan are subject to state of emergency measures that include a ban on alcohol sales at bars and restaurants – which must also close at 8pm – and requests to avoid travel and non-essential outings. On Sunday, similar restrictions will go into effect in Okinawa prefecture, which reported a record number of infections this week.

The state of emergency in Tokyo is due to end on May 31st, but health experts have cautioned that daily cases, while lower than last week, have not fallen to a level that would justify an easing of restrictions.

On Friday, Shigeru Omi, who heads the government’s coronavirus advisory panel, told MPs that organisers must consider the impact the Games could have on Japan’s medical infrastructure before deciding whether to go ahead.

Preparations for Tokyo 2020 have been hit by disruptions to the torch relay, while on Friday the Canadian swimming team became the latest delegation to pull out of a pre-Olympic training camp over coronavirus fears.

Plans for about 50 training camps have been scrapped, and dozens of Japanese towns have abandoned plans to host athletes. – Guardian","<article>

It said it wanted to give them a different perspective from the one they get within the club. “The briefings you receive [internally] are all very interesting but we’ll provide periodic updates giving a wider view,” the email said.

The email, which mentions the co-owners Joel and Avram Glazer in unflattering terms, centres on supporters’ main frustrations: the club debt, a perceived lack of investment in the first team and the state of Old Trafford – “as Gary Neville says the stadium is rotting”, it said.

“But, as I’ve said so many times, I’m going to give him until Tuesday night, the last training session, and see if he can try to be out there. Steadily but surely he’s improving but ligaments they take time to heal.”

The 6ft 8in paceman is bidding farewell to competitive cricket 18 years after making his Ireland bow as a teenager.

Rankin was a regular face in county cricket for well over a decade, most successfully during a long stint with Warwickshire, and will go down as one of his country’s best-loved players.

With 161 wickets across all three formats, he sits second only to Kevin O’Brien among Irish wicket-takers and featured in the memorable World Cup wins over Pakistan and England.

He would surely have been out on his own had it not been for his ultimately unsuccessful dalliance with the Three Lions. He stepped away from Ireland duty in 2012 and went on to play seven ODIs, two T20Is and a solitary Test for England.

The latter appearance, an Ashes Test in Sydney in the new year Test of 2014, might have been a crowning achievement but instead ended in disappointment, defeat and a bout of cramp.

Little more than two years later he was back in green and went on to play twice in Test cricket following their admission to the format.

“To retire from international cricket is a tough call, but I feel now is the right time to step away. I have put my heart and soul into playing cricket professionally since 2003 and have loved every minute of it,” he said.

“I never dreamt I would play for Ireland as much as I did and to travel the world playing in numerous World Cups and to pull on the Irish jersey is something I will never forget. To have also a long career in county cricket, especially during my 11-year stint with Warwickshire where we won the County Championship, 50-over competition twice and the T20 Blast in 2014 was very special and something I am very grateful for.

“I always strived to be the best player I could be and to play at the highest level possible, so to make my Test debut for England during a time when Ireland wasn’t a Test-playing nation was a very proud moment. I will miss all the guys I played alongside the most and enjoying the wins we had along the way.”

Ireland’s head coach Graham Ford added his own tribute.

“Unfortunately Father Time catches up with all cricketers. Sadly it is now Boyd’s time, but he can be so proud of his brilliant career,” he said.

“During my involvement with Cricket Ireland, he has been an ultimate professional, shown great courage while bowling through body niggles and put in many high impact performances.”","<article>

It underlines the financial muscle of the Premier League at the end of a season in which Manchester City and Chelsea have reached the Champions League final and Manchester United will contest the Europa League final. The Championship was the sixth-biggest spending league in Europe in 2020-21, outstripping the Portuguese, Dutch and Russian first divisions.

With head-spinning figures such as a €7.2 billion loss for Europe’s top-flight clubs since the pandemic began, Uefa concludes that transfer fees and wages “must be reduced to acceptable levels” if the game is to be restored to financial health.

The financial losses are stark, with the absence of fans the greatest blow: 210 million fewer clicks of the turnstile cost clubs across Uefa’s 55 member countries €4bn in revenue, the biggest loss over the period and greater than falls in sponsorship (€2.7bn) and broadcast revenue (€1.4bn).

Those losses in turn affected the transfer market. Spending in the 2020 summer window was down 39 per cent on the previous year, and this January’s winter window was down by 56 per cent on 2020. That the summer total was above that of any year before 2014 was down to English clubs.

The Premier League was by far the biggest spender in 2020-21 with more than €1.8bn traded, €600m more than in the next-largest spender, Serie A. The Championship total was €400m.

Some €558m went between English clubs but deals sending players from Spain, Germany and France to England were also in the top five most valuable transfer “flows”. This is not likely to continue, however, with Uefa predicting immigration changes brought about by Brexit are likely to lead English clubs to look equally at South America and Africa for recruits.

Uefa says reforms to its financial fair play rules are necessary, with controls on costs the key. Ultimately the annual “benchmarking” report concludes that football is “in essence a very stable business”, however, and that despite the pandemic “club revenue streams are fundamentally reliable”.

It does see one existential threat to the game, what it calls the “so-called” European Super League. “A closed breakaway league would destroy value across the whole pyramid,” the report says. “It is only by respecting the pyramid and the principle of promotion and relegation on sporting merit that European football will be able to continue to grow.”

Critics have argued that Uefa’s reforms to the Champions League undermine the values of sporting merit, with teams able to qualify based on historical performance rather than the position in their domestic league from 2024. Uefa sources say these proposals are subject to possible review.

In another jab at the ESL, Uefa challenges claims that the breakaway project would have given three times the money Uefa provides to clubs outside the Champions League. Calculating its future solidarity payments at €28bn compared with the ESL’s €10bn, the report observes: “Needless to say, $10bn is not three times $28bn.”

Uefa celebrates the ESL’s speedy demise and the “unanimous and resounding uproar” that brought it down. Its end may also have been hastened by an absence of expected support from Fifa. According to the New York Times, advisers to the ESL met Fifa representatives while drawing up their plans and were confident the governing body would endorse them only for Fifa to ultimately “express its disapproval” of the project in public.","<article>

<p>Critics have argued that Uefa’s reforms to the Champions League undermine the values of sporting merit, with teams able to qualify based on historical performance rather than the position in their domestic league from 2024. Uefa sources say these proposals are subject to possible review.</p>

<p>In another jab at the ESL, Uefa challenges claims that the breakaway project would have given three times the money Uefa provides to clubs outside the Champions League. Calculating its future solidarity payments at €28bn compared with the ESL’s €10bn, the report observes: “Needless to say, $10bn is not three times $28bn.”</p>

<p>Uefa celebrates the ESL’s speedy demise and the “unanimous and resounding uproar” that brought it down. Its end may also have been hastened by an absence of expected support from Fifa. According to the New York Times, advisers to the ESL met Fifa representatives while drawing up their plans and were confident the governing body would endorse them only for Fifa to ultimately “express its disapproval” of the project in public.</p>

It was a bold and challenging gesture to make, especially for Pogba and Diallo. The Manchester United pair work for a club owned by American billionaires, the Glazers. The founding member of the organisation, the late Malcolm Glazer was born in New York, the fifth of seven children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.

In 2016, his son Bryan Glazer donated €3.28 million for the renovation and conversion of a historic building in Tampa, Florida into the Bryan Glazer Family Jewish Community Centre.

After Manchester United’s match with Fulham, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer declined to alter the political mood or bust out diplomatic moves. Instead he jumped to the defence of his two players, explaining that his team is one of different backgrounds, different cultures and different countries.

Team changing rooms were hothouses for suppressed emotions, casual racism, places where honesty was mistaken for weakness

PSV Eindhoven’s Israeli forward Eran Zahavi responded too. He posted an edited picture of the pair on Instagram, replacing the Palestine flag they were carrying with one from Israel.

Pogba is French born to Guinean parents. While he plays for France, his two brothers Florentin and Mathias play with the Guinean national team. He is Muslim. Diallo was born in Abidjan in Ivory Coast and immigrated to Italy as a child. He is Muslim too, as is Choudhury, who has played for England and has Bangladeshi-Grenadian ancestry, while Fofana is French-born of Malian decent.

What has been evident for some time in football, in Europe at least, is a power shift from the boardroom to the pitch and the bathing of traditional monochrome British football culture in a multicultural wash. With that comes attitude and some enlightenment.

Players, with Mo Salah, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford all assuming dignified social postures, have been empowered and have come to believe in themselves as much as functions of their beliefs and experiences as bland corporate faces in clubs like Manchester United or Liverpool.

In the past, cheesy photo opportunities of football stars visiting a children’s hospital or handing an oversized cheque to a local charity would do it.

But team changing rooms were hothouses for suppressed emotions, casual racism, places where honesty was mistaken for weakness and any political views outside the traditional norm seen as perilous and threatening.

Largely, footballers were emotionally constrained and conservative, politically inert. There were exceptions, like Bill Shankly and Robbie Fowler.

Homophobic abuse

In 1997 Fowler had just scored his second goal in a European Cup Winners Cup against Norway’s Brann Bergan when he lifted up his Liverpool shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the slogan “Support the 500 sacked dockers”. For that he was fined 2,000 Swiss Francs by Uefa.

It was Fowler again whose actions in an incident inspired a tirade of homophobic abuse at Graeme Le Saux in 1999. Le Saux complained to the referee and linesman, who saw the incident but took no action. The Chelsea player was then booked for time-wasting. Not just the players but officials were also complicit and capable of contradiction.

But the goalposts have moved and continue to do so. For every note of irresponsible arrogance, every shot of a millionaire footballer spilling from a night club into a Lamborghini, there is a Rashford using his name, image and money to embarrass a government into extending free school meals to children.

If nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem

There is a Mesut Ozil taking aim in 2019 at Muslim countries for their silence over the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China, his club Arsenal distancing itself.

In 2019 a study – Can Exposure to Celebrities Reduce Prejudice? The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes – conducted by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University in the United States, found the number of hate crimes in the Merseyside area had fallen since Salah joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017.

Over the previous two years there were 18.9 per cent fewer hate crimes than predicted, and a 53 per cent fall in anti-Muslim tweets among Liverpool fans.

Last June, on the day Premier League matches resumed after lockdown, every player, referee and official took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.

That came almost three years after American footballer Colin Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing league owners of collusion to keep him out of the league for doing exactly that.

The Glazer family, through their ownership of the NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers, would have been party to Kaepernick’s grievances.

At Manchester United, they could if they wished take action against Pogba and Diallo. But the Premier League is not the NFL and Europe is not the USA.

The sport has seismically shifted and whatever side people pick, Palestinian or Israeli, the majority of public sentiment probably rests with 63 dead children in Gaza.

If nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem. That kind of interrogation cuts both ways and different sides will be taken. Football’s makeover is players being a truthful version of themselves, a pose that would never have been tolerated in the past.","<article>

Half the goings on in the League of Ireland can be difficult to comprehend, whereas the other half seem downright insane. Not that anyone doubts the explanation provided by Waterford FC’s new manager Marc Bircham following last year’s stint in a Florida penitentiary.

The most enticing game tonight is Shamrock Rovers’ trip to Oriel Park, mainly because Dundalk’s sporting director/interim manager Jim Magilton hopes to divert the natives’ planned march on the stadium before kick-off to protest against the Hulsizer family’s control of the club.

After two wins from 11 outings, Magilton must be desperate to steady the ship, but the resounding quote to come out of the embattled club belongs to club chairman Bill Hulsizer.

“I don’t care what people say,” declared the 78-year-old father of Dundalk owner Matt Hulsizer last month, before adding that a supporters banner will not “affect any decision that I make or Jim makes”.

Tennis balls at the ready.

Turmoil at Dundalk barely holds a candle to the narrative Waterford created by hiring Bircham.

I’d be lying if I said it was the best job in the world

With the club bottom of the Premier Division ahead of Derry City’s visit to the Regional Sports Centre, Bircham has a near impossible task to avoid relegation. Undeterred, the cheeky-chappy Londoner emerged from quarantine on Wednesday to join the dots since prematurely leaving what seemed a dream role as technical director for the Bahamas FA.

Turns out Lewisham’s finest and Waterford FC owner Lee Power threw his former squire a lifeline.

“Funnily enough,” quipped Bircham, “[Power] probably don’t remember but I was his boot boy at Millwall when I was a youth team player. So many moons ago that he’d forgotten about it when I mentioned it to him so that was I think the last time we met, when I was in the youth team, when I was a lot slimmer and a lot better looking, so he probably didn’t recognise me.”

Anyway, the one-time blue and white mohawked QPR midfielder found himself in a spot of bother last year, getting an orange jumpsuit mugshot that will follow him around until the 43-year-old creates a more spectacular story, either on or off the pitch.

Bircham’s entire perspective is available on the Under The Cosh podcast but, in a nutshell, dinner with friends in Tampa went sour when a “geezer” who claimed to be a two-tour marine in Afghanistan and Iraq threatened to kill the father of four “with his bare hands”.

After escaping a choke-hold Bircham “immobilised” Captain America with “one punch”. Next thing he remembers the cops were “coming in like a Swat team” to his friend’s home and before the former Canadian international could claim self-defence he was banged up abroad. There was another scrap in county lock-up when he refused to give a large inmate his bed sheet.

Maybe coaching football in the sunny southeast is just what the doctor ordered, but Bircham is adamant the situation could have been cleared up by the police watching all the CCTV footage while categorically denying the lacerations on his assailant’s face were caused by his right hook.

Anyway, the Londoner does not seem traumatised by the affair, with old stab wound scars on his torso getting nods of approval from fellow jail birds as they gathered to watch Harry Potter.

Asked this week why he’s earning a crust in Waterford and not the West Indies, Bircham responded: “Very similar settings to the Bahamas, I feel quite at home here, moving from there to here. It is by the sea. Very similar weather.”

Greatest league in the world, Marc.

“I’d be lying if I said it was the best job in the world . . . Maybe it’s because they are bottom of the league and the only way is up. Like every coach out there you think, ‘I can turn it around’.

“Whether you can or not is a different story. I work on a gut feeling a lot and I had a gut feeling that I really fancied it. Or maybe I’m mental! We’ll know in a couple of months.”","<article>

“He’s definitely not selected,” said Magilton before noting that “he could be” in the running for the job.

Magilton, who is currently double jobbing as interim manager, added: “I haven’t ruled anyone out.

“I spoke to Jim, yeah, I did. I’ve always been a huge fan. I’ve always loved GAA and I liked his approach to Donegal. A winning brand.

“Jim has been a successful manager, albeit in a different sport, but I believe there are so many crossovers. There is no question about that.

“I’ve spoke to other people as well.

“Listen, I’ve had really good conversations this week, believe it or not, and I’ve enjoyed them. We’ll get to the [mid-season] break [on Friday week] and we’ll take it from there. There has been one or two interesting ones.”

When Magilton, who is on record stating he wants a coach more than a manager, was asked if anyone at the club has suggested bringing former manager Vinnie Perth back into the fold, the former Northern Ireland international replied: “No, not to me. I know it is out there but definitely not to me.”

McGuinness, an All-Ireland winner with Donegal as both player and manager, made the shift into soccer coaching with Glasgow Celtic from 2012 to 2017, before working under Roger Schmidt at Beijing Guoan and a disappointing stint in 2019 as Charlotte Independence manager when the 48-year-old was released six months into a three-year contract after only winning once in 14 matches.

McGuinness subsequently did the Uefa pro licence course alongside Robbie Keane and Damien Duff.

“My focus is definitely on soccer and the journey that I’ve been on development-wise and trying to fulfil that,” he said in October 2020. “I’m open to anything that makes sense for me professionally and in terms of my own development.

“I’ve had a very good journey up to this point and have been learning a huge amount along the way. Obviously when you are in management on a professional level, you learn a lot.”","<article>

The Portugal defender was a comfortable winner ahead of Tottenham’s Harry Kane and his City teammate Kevin De Bruyne.

Dias has enjoyed an outstanding first campaign at City since a club record €74.6 million transfer from Benfica.

He has helped Pep Guardiola’s squad win the Carabao Cup, regain the Premier League title and reach the Champions League final, in which they face Chelsea in Porto on May 29th.

Nine City players received votes from the Football Writers’ Association membership, accounting for more than 50 per cent of the ballot. The last defender to collect the trophy, which has been presented since 1948, was Liverpool’s Steve Nicol in 1989.

Dias described the award as “a huge privilege” and paid tribute to his colleagues before focusing on what lies ahead.

“I heard someone from the club say: ‘We live in the middle of the storm,’” he said.

“Sometimes we don’t even have time to celebrate, to think too much about things, we just move on. We must not shut it off, we just let it go, because at the end of it all it is beautiful what is happening.

“But next year it will be a new challenge, a new season – and as a footballer you just need to be hungry every time.”

Dias is only the third player to win the writers’ award in his first season in English football, following Jürgen Klinsmann, in 1995, and Gianfranco Zola in 1997.","<article>

33-year-old Parsons announced his retirement from intercounty football in January and will take up his new role with the GPA later this year.

Parsons made 84 appearances for Mayo after his 2008 debut in a career which lasted 12 years - his last county appearance coming in last year’s All-Ireland semi-final win over Tipperary.

He suffered a potentially career-ending and life-changing knee injury in a game againt Galway in May 2018 but recovered sufficiently to return in the All-Ireland semi-final against Dublin the following year.

On his new role, the Charlestown Sarsfields clubman said: “I am absolutely delighted and honoured to be appointed as the CEO of the GPA. I truly believe in the great work of the Association and, from personal experience, the GPA has supported me in my sporting, personal and professional life since my debut with Mayo in 2008.

“As a player, I feel I have experienced nearly all the challenges, highs and lows a player can face. I know how important it is to have an association that unconditionally cares for every player. I’m committed to build on the great work of our previous CEO Paul Flynn and I’m privileged to have the opportunity to work with a dynamic, dedicated team in the GPA who have the player at the heart of all decisions.

“A huge motivation for me was the decision by players to merge the GPA and WGPA in December of 2020. I feel this truly represents the leadership of our male and female intercounty players and I’m committed to serve the voice of all our players to the best of my ability. I look forward to taking up the position later in the summer.”

Parsons had previously been a member of the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the GPA since 2017 and a member of the board of directors since 2019.

He had also previously been the GPA Secretary and more recently held the position of Chairman of the NEC. Following the merger with the WGPA, Parsons has co-Chaired the NEC alongside Maria Kinsella.","<article>

The Premier League outfit has struck “strategic partnerships” with four clubs across the UK and Ireland to expand its scouting network. Portadown, Ayr United and Welsh side Llandudno have entered a similar arrangement in the wake of Velocity sports partners, the sports investment arm of ALK capital, acquiring an 84 per cent stake in Burnley last December.

Ramblers have a relationship with Burnley dating back to 1921, when the Cork club adopted the English league champion’s claret and blue colours, but this formal two year deal provides immediate benefit for Cobh’s academy and soon to be established women’s side, as they will play their new partners in pre-season tournaments.

Along with a focus on sending over young talent, Cobh expects to benefit from Burnley’s coaching and commercial expertise.

“What is very important is the way Burnley have negotiated with us,” said Cobh chairman Bill O’Leary. “They have treated us with great respect. We feel they are the right sized club [to partner with] and they have certainly performed way beyond what you would expect from the region.

“It is not a very big region in population terms but they are now a well established Premier League club, so there is learnings there for us in terms of how we could do something similar.

“Aligning ourselves with a Premier League club brings real opportunity and attractiveness in us bringing underage players through our academy, so that is a big feature,” O’Leary added. “As is the ability of players to go both ways as the seasons are complimentary.”

Cobh, who received a fee of £47,000 from Nottingham Forest for a 19 year-old Roy Keane in 1990, do expect compensation when a player they send to Burnley is sold to another club, but the terms of this arrangement have to be “fully detailed out.”

“It is timely now,” said O’Leary. “It makes a lot of sense for us geopolitically and for many other reasons.

“I think to some extent we are breaking new ground here. Ok, there are one or two other relationships [like Sligo Rovers and Everton] but we are another piece of that jigsaw. We want this relationship to be really demonstrable, tangible and of a mutual benefit.

“This relationship will only be as good as the amount of work we put into it but it has got to be underpinned by a really positive, transparent intent and I think that is there now, for sure.”

At present there is no financial aspect to the partnership with Cobh hoping it will offer a way around restrictions put on Irish teenagers travelling to England post-Brexit.

“This is very much the first step in our plans to expand the football network of Burnley, build the relevance of our club beyond the north west of England and ensure that Burnley’s academy continues to be a high-performance hotbed for future first team players and international footballers,” said Burnley chairman Alan Pace.

Pace is also ALK capital’s managing partner, having begun his financial career Lehman Brothers where he became managing director before Dave Checketts, the former New York Knicks president and owner of Real Salt Lake, hired him as chief executive of the Major League Soccer club.

In 2008 Pace, a southern California native whose father hails from the north of England, returned to the financial world to guide Citi bank out of the global financial crisis, eventually serving as managing director before leaving to form ALK in 2019.

Pace immediately added Checketts, who almost convinced Michael Jordan to sign for the Knicks in 1998, to the Burnley board along with Antonio Davila, a senior academic at the business school in Barcelona where Pace gained a master’s degree in international finance.

The Clarets, who are about to enter their sixth straight season in the Premier League, have a reduced Irish connection in recent times although Robbie Brady, Jimmy Dunne and Kevin Long remain a part of Sean Dyche’s first team squad.

None of them featured in last night’s 3-0 defeat to Liverpool at Turf Moor, although Jimmy Dunne was on the bench, with Brady and Long expected to miss next month’s Republic of Ireland friendlies against Andorra and Hungary due to injury.

The number of Irish players at the club should increase in the next two years but, as Pace makes abundantly clear, ties with lower league teams are just one element of the American’s plans for the club he purchased by leveraging Burnley’s assets in a similar fashion to how the Glazer family took over Manchester United before loading the club with £525 million in debt.

ALK capital remain adamant that their financial approached is “reasonable and sustainable.” Cobh Ramblers would certainly hope so.","<article>

<p>Pace immediately added Checketts, who almost convinced <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Jordan"">Michael Jordan</a> to sign for the Knicks in 1998, to the Burnley board along with <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Antonio+Davila"">Antonio Davila</a>, a senior academic at the business school in Barcelona where Pace gained a master’s degree in international finance.</p>

<p>The Clarets, who are about to enter their sixth straight season in the Premier League, have a reduced Irish connection in recent times although <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Robbie+Brady"">Robbie Brady</a>, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jimmy+Dunne"">Jimmy Dunne</a> and <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Long"">Kevin Long</a> remain a part of Sean Dyche’s first team squad.</p>

<p>None of them featured in last night’s 3-0 defeat to <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Liverpool"">Liverpool</a> at Turf Moor, although Jimmy Dunne was on the bench, with Brady and Long expected to miss next month’s Republic of Ireland friendlies against Andorra and Hungary due to injury.</p>

<p>The number of Irish players at the club should increase in the next two years but, as Pace makes abundantly clear, ties with lower league teams are just one element of the American’s plans for the club he purchased by leveraging Burnley’s assets in a similar fashion to how the Glazer family took over <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Manchester+United"">Manchester United</a> before loading the club with £525 million in debt.</p>

<p>ALK capital remain adamant that their financial approached is “reasonable and sustainable.” Cobh Ramblers would certainly hope so.</p>

Liverpool’s seventh win in nine unbeaten Premier League games elevated them into the top four with one game to play and victory over Crystal Palace at Anfield on Sunday, in what will be Roy Hodgson’s final top-flight game, should secure Champions League football. Klopp’s side have a goal difference of plus four over Leicester, who face missing out on the final day for the second season in succession.

“I couldn’t be more pleased,” the Liverpool manager said. “It is not that we took these things for granted. This season has been incredibly tough and February was the last time we were in the top four and we didn’t win a lot of games since then. In the last eight, 10 games, I don’t know how many, we are back on track. If we win on Sunday then we are probably qualified for the Champions League.

“It’s insane that we came this close but we are not through yet. When you win the semi-final you go to a final and that’s where we are. We will give our absolute everything.”

Nat Phillips scored his first Liverpool goal and produced a superb goal-line clearance to preserve the clean sheet. Klopp admitted: “I love the boy, he knows that, but let’s see if we make it or not and talk about him after Crystal Palace. When the season is finished I could write a book about Nat Phillips and Rhys Williams, but we are not there yet. Let them stay focused and recover and then we can talk about them. I promise you I will talk about them for an hour after that.”

Sean Dyche claimed Liverpool are “purring” going into the final game and their quality in front of goal made the difference at Turf Moor.

The Burnley manager, who confirmed Ashley Barnes was arrested recently for drink driving, said: “They are a quality side and are purring at the moment. They did take their chances clinically.

“We matched them pretty well overall, we have created chances, we have had more of the ball than we have had ever against Liverpool. But there is a gap: they had three shots on target and scored three. We had some great moments tonight which we should create more from and do better.” - Guardian","<article>

West Ham strode closer to Europe thanks to late goals by Angelo Ogbonna and Michail Antonio. Tomas Soucek opened the scoring unintentionally, flicking a corner by Matheus Pereira into his own goal. But the Czech then led the comeback, equalising just before half-time. Both teams chased victory after that but West Ham landed the decisive blows, leaving West Brom with no reward for a vibrant performance, again. West Ham will reach Europe if they avoid defeat to Southampton on Sunday, while the Baggies announced after the game that head coach Sam Allardyce would step down at the end of the season.

The 6,000 fans spread across the Hawthorns were in festive mood, their spirits lifted by being allowed to return to the ground for the first time in over 14 months, even if it was just to wave at their team on the way down to the Championship. This might also have been a hello and goodbye to Sam Allardyce, who, by kick-off, had yet to reveal whether he will be West Brom’s manager beyond the end of the season.

By contrast, David Moyes is almost certain to stay in situ at West Ham, whose this season counts as a success despite the fact that the flirtation with Champions League qualification turned out to be illusory. No matter, West Ham are not too arrogant to strive for a place in a lesser European competition. They started with a rousing hunger – and that was enough to provoke West Brom into an all too familiar defensive mistake.

Just 36 seconds had elapsed when Semi Ajayi left a backpass short. Sam Johnstone rushed out to tidy up but was beaten to the ball by Antonio and wound up bringing down the striker. Declan Rice stepped up to mete out punishment but rammed the penalty against the base of a post. Trivia fans may have been tickled to learn that was the earliest spot-kick miss since the formation of the Premier League; home supporters just rejoiced at the welcome change of fortune for their largely luckless team.

Pereira, West Brom’s most regular source of joy this season, set about giving them cause for further glee but Darren Randolph saved his flicked header easily. Johnstone then rose to the more difficult challenge of tipping a swerving long-range shot by Saïd Benrahma over the bar.

The players seemed to enjoy themselves, with no trace of late-season fatigue as they hurtled from end to end. The hosts created the clearer chances. Pereira fired just wide from the edge of the area in the 21st minute.

Then the Brazilian produced something almost as improbable as the goal scored here for Liverpool on Sunday by his goalkeeping compatriot, Alisson. Pereira helped to give West Brom the lead by curling a corner in towards the near post; Soucek leapt to head clear but succeeded only in glancing it past his own goalkeeper.

Pereira would have doubled the hosts’ lead if not for an excellent save by Randolph, but then, in stoppage time at the end of the first half, Soucek drew his team level, tapping in at the back post after exquisite service from Benrahma.

Benrahma continued to deliver, feeding Pablo Fornals in the 49th minute. The Spaniard’s curler from the corner of the area flew inches wide. In keeping with the tit-for-tat pattern of the first period, West Brom were next to threaten, Randolph reacting sharply to smother the ball after Ajayi tried to poke it past him following a to-do in the area. Aaron Cresswell took Johnstone by surprise in the 65th minute by going for goal with a free-kick from 35 yards, the goalkeeper relieved to see it hit the outside of the post.

Johnstone denied Fornals in the 81st minute but West Brom could not hold out as, from the resultant corner, Ogbonna headed Cresswell’s delivery into the net from close range. Jesse Lingard, mostly quiet, sent Antonio through to complete the scoring two minutes from time.","<article>

The 1998 World Cup-winning captain sought to become a World Cup-winning coach not by repeatedly picking the best 23 players, but by moulding a squad defined by togetherness and bereft of cliques and clashing egos. As such, the inclusion of Karim Benzema in his 26-man party for Euro 2020 after nearly six years out in the cold was more than surprising. Deschamps’ unusually bold decision could destabilise all that he has worked so hard to achieve.

Deschamps knows the value of an excellent atmosphere more than most. In recent decades, French society has regularly been divided along racial or religious lines. But the side he captained in 1998 – which was often referred to as “black, blanc, beur” or “black, white, Arab” – brought a fractious society together by representing all of France. “It was not about religion or the colour of your skin, we didn’t care about that,” Zinedine Zidane said later. “We were just together and enjoyed the moment.”

In contrast, Raymond Domenech found out at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa just how quickly a France squad could be destabilised by conflicting egos. The various scenes – Patrice Evra confronting assistant coach Robert Duverne; the squad hiding on the team bus in support of Nicolas Anelka following his row with Domenech; the forlorn-looking coach himself reading a squad statement denouncing the French authorities – amounted to a national disgrace as the team crashed out of the tournament without a win.

Since Deschamps’ appointment in 2012, troublesome influences have been slowly phased out. His tactic of placing harmony above all else has unequivocally worked. France are world champions and were the width of a post away from winning Euro 2016. Benzema was absent from both tournaments after the infamous Mathieu Valbuena “sex-tape” scandal engulfed the squad, further accentuating divisions among players.

His return amounts to a stunning admission: that Deschamps and France need Benzema. And, perhaps more flabbergasting still, that Deschamps is willing to risk his camp’s togetherness despite its success so far. “We met, we spoke at length, I then thought very hard and came to this decision,” said Deschamps. “I needed this chat. He needed this chat. As national team boss, I have always looked beyond my personal case. My responsibility is important. It’s bigger than me.”

Although one L’Équipe journalist reported that some players in the camp were “crazy excited” by Benzema’s call-up, he will do well to avoid a collision course with incumbent centre-forward Olivier Giroud. When compared with Giroud last year, Benzema remarked: “You don’t confuse Formula 1 with karting, and I am being nice.”

Scandal

Meanwhile, the scandal of the sex tape still hangs over Benzema. If anything, his legal situation has worsened over time. He will stand trial in October for allegedly acting as an intermediary between a group of blackmailers and Valbuena, and for allegedly pressuring his former teammate to pay off the blackmailers. After being dropped from the France squad after the scandal, Benzema accused Deschamps of “yielding under the pressure of a racist part of France” by not picking him.

Just because he has returned to the squad does not necessarily mean he will start. The fact he will wear the No 19 shirt could be a sign that Giroud will remain first choice. Deschamps has remained coy on his team selection. “They have played together before,” he mused. “They don’t actually get in each other’s way. Giroud has been in a difficult situation in his club since February. That is a fact.”

Although Giroud has been marginalised since Thomas Tuchel’s arrival at Chelsea, a goal every 100 minutes in the Premier League and Champions League this season is stronger than Benzema’s ratio of a goal every 130 minutes in La Liga and Europe. Giroud’s international record is better too.

However, Benzema’s quality will be hard to ignore after perhaps the best season of his career. Leaving him out of the starting XI would be bizarre after the furore and risks taken in bringing him back. Yet Giroud embodies Deschamps’ philosophy. A functional, malleable player who puts his team and his colleagues first, his relentless dummy-running and counter-pressing made time and space for Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbappé as France won the World Cup.

Benzema admitted as much himself, saying: “His style of play suits the French national team well. It works because he is there, that is the only reason. He is good because there are players like Mbappé or Griezmann who are fast and who play in the channels and pivot around the centre-forward. Him, up top, he weighs on defences, which allows the two others to move a lot and show a lot. He blocks and it works. It won’t be spectacular, he won’t do something amazing, but he has his thing.”

Although Benzema has become Real Madrid’s only reliable source of goals in recent seasons and something of a talisman for the club, the role he describes is similar to the one he perfected in support of Cristiano Ronaldo as Madrid won a hat-trick of Champions League titles. He could do the same for France.

As Deschamps suggested, he could deploy both together in the asymmetric 4-2-3-1 he used in Russia. Benzema could even be used out wide as he was during the 2014 World Cup to such devastating effect in partnership with Giroud in the 5-2 win over Switzerland.

At 33, however, that seems unlikely. While a front three of Griezmann, Mbappé and Benzema is a thrilling proposition – a possible 4-3-3 would also free up Paul Pogba in midfield – Benzema may have to earn his place. With just two warmup friendlies his inclusion may only be cemented, assuming his club form persists, deeper into the tournament.

Although Deschamps admitted “the list a year ago would not have been the one I have today” his squad remains perhaps the strongest and deepest at the tournament. While nine world champions missed out, only Samuel Umtiti and Blaise Matuidi are absent from Deschamps’ first choice XI from 2018.

Even though his performances have been shaky in recent months, Presnel Kimpembe will start as Raphaël Varane’s partner in defence, with Sevilla defender Jules Koundé and Kurt Zouma in reserve. Manchester City’s Aymeric Laporte was again overlooked but will almost certainly play in the tournament for Spain.

Anthony Martial is also absent, as “his condition does not allow it” Deschamps explained, while Houssem Aouar and Eduardo Camavinga’s recent poor club form meant both were omitted too. Adrien Rabiot, who dramatically refused to be on the reserve list in 2018, made the full squad this time and could be used on the left of Deschamps’ lopsided 4-2-3-1, with Matuidi’s international career now over after he joined MLS outfit Inter Miami. Moussa Sissoko, a Deschamps favourite and key figure in achieving squad unity, again made the squad despite his lack of recent game time for Tottenham.

Benzema’s return could be an inspired move from Deschamps. With most of the group embroiled in the 2010 incident and the blackmail scandal now fading from memory, old divisions may have simply melted away. Mbappé immediately tweeted his support for Benzema and it was reported that Giroud did not object.","<article>

A functional, malleable player who puts his team and his colleagues first, his relentless dummy-running and counter-pressing made time and space for <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Antoine+Griezmann"">Antoine Griezmann</a> and Kylian Mbappé as France won the World Cup.</p>

<p>Benzema admitted as much himself, saying: “His style of play suits the French national team well. It works because he is there, that is the only reason. He is good because there are players like Mbappé or Griezmann who are fast and who play in the channels and pivot around the centre-forward. Him, up top, he weighs on defences, which allows the two others to move a lot and show a lot. He blocks and it works. It won’t be spectacular, he won’t do something amazing, but he has his thing.”</p>

<p>Although Benzema has become Real Madrid’s only reliable source of goals in recent seasons and something of a talisman for the club, the role he describes is similar to the one he perfected in support of <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Cristiano+Ronaldo"">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as Madrid won a hat-trick of Champions League titles. He could do the same for France.</p>

<p>As Deschamps suggested, he could deploy both together in the asymmetric 4-2-3-1 he used in Russia. Benzema could even be used out wide as he was during the 2014 World Cup to such devastating effect in partnership with Giroud in the 5-2 win over Switzerland.</p>

<p>At 33, however, that seems unlikely. While a front three of Griezmann, Mbappé and Benzema is a thrilling proposition – a possible 4-3-3 would also free up <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Pogba"">Paul Pogba</a> in midfield – Benzema may have to earn his place. With just two warmup friendlies his inclusion may only be cemented, assuming his club form persists, deeper into the tournament.</p>

<p>Although Deschamps admitted “the list a year ago would not have been the one I have today” his squad remains perhaps the strongest and deepest at the tournament. While nine world champions missed out, only <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Samuel+Umtiti"">Samuel Umtiti</a> and <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Blaise+Matuidi"">Blaise Matuidi</a> are absent from Deschamps’ first choice XI from 2018.</p>

<p>Even though his performances have been shaky in recent months, Presnel Kimpembe will start as Raphaël Varane’s partner in defence, with <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Sevilla"">Sevilla</a> defender Jules Koundé and <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kurt+Zouma"">Kurt Zouma</a> in reserve. Manchester City’s <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aymeric+Laporte"">Aymeric Laporte</a> was again overlooked but will almost certainly play in the tournament for Spain.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Anthony+Martial"">Anthony Martial</a> is also absent, as “his condition does not allow it” Deschamps explained, while <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Houssem+Aouar"">Houssem Aouar</a> and Eduardo Camavinga’s recent poor club form meant both were omitted too. <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Adrien+Rabiot"">Adrien Rabiot</a>, who dramatically refused to be on the reserve list in 2018, made the full squad this time and could be used on the left of Deschamps’ lopsided 4-2-3-1, with Matuidi’s international career now over after he joined MLS outfit Inter Miami. <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Moussa+Sissoko"">Moussa Sissoko</a>, a Deschamps favourite and key figure in achieving squad unity, again made the squad despite his lack of recent game time for Tottenham.</p>

<p>Benzema’s return could be an inspired move from Deschamps. With most of the group embroiled in the 2010 incident and the blackmail scandal now fading from memory, old divisions may have simply melted away. Mbappé immediately tweeted his support for Benzema and it was reported that Giroud did not object.</p>

Jürgen Klopp is accustomed to his seasons going down to the wire but the identity of the men who have left Liverpool on the cusp of Champions League qualification may have surprised even him. First Alisson at West Bromwich Albion, now Nat Phillips at Burnley; the unlikeliest influences are behind the late rescue act.

Phillips headed home his first Liverpool goal and was at the forefront of a valuable clean sheet as Klopp’s side secured another precious victory in their bid for a top four finish. The defeat of Sean Dyche’s team, commenced by Roberto Firmino and finished by substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, elevated Liverpool above Leicester in the race for Champions League football and improved their goal difference over Brendan Rodgers’ team to plus four. One more win, over Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace in the former Liverpool manager’s last top flight game, and redemption will be found on the final day at Anfield.

Burnley had altered the course of Liverpool’s season in January with the away win that ended the then champions’ 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield and sparked an unprecedented six-match losing streak on home soil.

Their prospects of also derailing Liverpool’s Champions League prospects did not look so bright at Turf Moor, where Sean Dyche’s team last won a Premier League game in January and had taken merely five points from the last 27 available. They also had a goalkeeper, Will Norris, making his Premier League debut for the club in place of the injured Nick Pope. The 27-year-old’s previous top flight experience amounted to an 89th minute substitute appearance for Wolves in 2018-19.

With Chris Wood up against a vulnerable Liverpool central defence, however, and Dwight McNeil, Matthew Lowton and Johann Gudmundsson aiming for the New Zealand striker at almost every opportunity, Burnley had the armoury – and a vociferous backing – to serve up another uncomfortable evening for Klopp’s side. But the visitors, while uncertain in the heart of defence, were vibrant, dangerous and assured in every other department and created enough clear-cut chances to have established a commanding lead by the break.

Burnley started well but were sliced open from Liverpool’s first attack of note when a fine ball from Andy Robertson released Mohamed Salah behind the home defence. An excellent covering tackle by Ben Mee prevented the Egypt international from taking full advantage. Mee’s central defensive partner, James Tarkowski, produced a similar challenge to deny Sadio Mané when Salah found the striker unmarked inside the area.

Mané had missed the game’s first genuine opening when Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cross deflected into his path in front of Norris’ goal. The Senegal forward steered his shot wide at full stretch. Firmino turned a decent chance wide from Mané’s back-heel, Thiago Alcântara dragged a shot wide of the far post following a neat exchange inside the area with Salah and, seconds later, with Robertson taking a leaf out of Burnley’s book to launch a long ball over the top, Liverpool’s leading goalscorer blazed over with only Norris to beat. When Phillips sent a half volley high over from Rhys Williams’ knock-down, the sense that Liverpool might be made to pay once again for their profligacy intensified. But one flowing move later, they were ahead.

Robertson combined with Mané down the left and, with Gudmundsson failing to track the full-back’s run, he pulled an inviting cross back from the by-line for the unmarked Firmino to side-foot home from 12 yards. Norris should have done better with a shot that was close to his left leg and Turf Moor, for once, fell silent bar the sound of a celebrating Klopp.

Burnley had engineered, and missed, several opportuntites of their own prior to Firmino’s breakthrough. Lowton was unfortunate with a goal-bound drive that struck Williams’ head and deflected over, while Alisson saved bravely at the feet of Wood following a goalmouth scramble and from McNeil’s powerful drive. Liverpool’s goalscoring goalkeeper should have been given no chance when Wood latched on to Lowton’s ball into the area only to slice wide on the half volley from close range.

Liverpool were far more polished in attack, patient too, and doubled their lead early in the second half through Phillips’ first goal for the club. The centre-half had grown into his duel with Wood and also shone at the opposite end of the pitch when Mané beat Lowton to the by-line and lofted an inch-perfect cross into the area. Phillips, somehow escaping the attentions of the Burnley defence, rose to plant an unstoppable header beyond the exposed Norris.

Phillips excelled again to head off the line from Mee when the Burnley captain met McNeil’s corner with a towering back post header. Burnley continued to battle but in the final minute Oxlade-Chamberlain, receiving Robertson’s pass into the area, bamboozled Charlie Taylor with fine footwork before driving inside Norris’ near post. – Guardian","<article>

The Bristol City winger and Burnley centre half are definitely out of next month’s friendlies against Andorra and Hungary. Long’s club mate Robbie Brady is also unlikely to feature after damaging his achilles tendon against Qatar last March.

Kenny’s options are expected to be weakened further by Ciaran Clark, Jeff Hendrick, Enda Stevens and Alan Browne withdrawing from the 10-day training camp in Girona, Spain as the quartet need rest or minor procedures due to missing an off-season in 2020.

James McClean is available having played 90 minutes for Stoke City reserves on Monday.

The Andorra game on June 3rd has been switched to Estadi Johan Cruyff in Barcelona, to avoid mandatory hotel quarantine on return to Ireland, but this suits the squad as they are a 90 minute drive from the 6,000 capacity venue mainly used by FC Barcelona’s B team.

Andorra is one of six European countries on the Irish Government’s mandatory hotel quarantine list along with Belgium, France, Georgia, Turkey and Luxembourg.

Kenny’s summer camp ends against Hungary at the Szusza Ferenc stadium in Budapest on June 8th. The full squad will be announced Monday before meeting up in Spain the following Friday, May 28th.

The Dubliner is still seeking his first competitive victory as Ireland manager after four draws and seven defeats since taking over from Mick McCarthy in April 2020.

Vera Pauw’s Republic of Ireland team will also play two friendlies during a 10-day trip to Iceland between June 6th and 16th, both matches are in Reykjavik and will be shown live on the RTÉ Player.

“We have made a lot of positive strides in recent months in each of our sessions together and this week, with two tough games, will provide us with another opportunity to continue that work,” said Pauw despite Ireland losing their last five matches. “For this window, we had many different options but ultimately we chose to play against Iceland [TWICE], who are ranked 17th in the World and have qualified for Euro 2022.

“Just like our decision to play Denmark and Belgium in April [both 1-0 defeats], we want to test ourselves against high calibre opposition.”

Ireland open their 2023 World Cup qualifying campaign away to Georgia on September 17th.

Kane is open to joining City but he and his suitors are aware that negotiations with Daniel Levy will be far from straightforward.

Tottenham’s chairman is not inclined to sell Kane, who has told the club he would like to leave and believes he effectively got a verbal agreement from Levy last summer to go at the end of this season.

City’s record transfer fee is less than £65m and they would have to part with more than twice that if Levy consented to a deal for Kane. With Sergio Agüero about to depart, City are determined to secure a player who would strengthen a squad that has won the Premier League and Carabao Cup this season and could add the Champions League this month. They have been in touch with Kane’s representatives.

Manchester United’s interest in Kane appears to have waned since Edinson Cavani committed to a further year, but it could be revived. There has been no move yet for the England captain from Chelsea – and Levy would be especially resistant to doing a deal with them.

Tottenham will try to convince Kane to stay and the appointment of a new manager could be part of that process, but the 27-year-old’s position is clear. He is due to play in front of the club’s fans against Aston Villa on Wednesday.

Levy has acknowledged in his programme notes that errors have been made in the recent past: “We have been so focused on delivering the stadium and dealing with the impact of the pandemic, that I feel we lost sight of some key priorities and what’s truly in our DNA.

“Our work in the community and with the NHS is an example of when we get it right, but we don’t get everything right. It has never been because we don’t care about or respect you, our fans – nothing could be further from the truth.”

He said “a successful football team” was paramount and that “everyone’s focus is on a return to regular Champions League participation and competing for honours”. – Guardian","<article>

Müller and Hummels, winners of the 2014 World Cup under Löw, were some of the players dropped after Germany’s disappointing 2018 World Cup first-round exit and their poor Nations League performance later that year. But an overhaul interrupted by the pandemic failed to yield tangible results as the team crashed to their biggest competitive defeat – a 6-0 loss to Spain – as recently as last November.

“You can interrupt an overhaul under the circumstances,” Löw said on Wednesday. “In the defence we did not have the desired stability recently and … experience may have been missing in some games.

“Mats is a player who influences other players and brings experience,” said Löw, who also praised Müller’s superb season with Bayern Munich. Müller has managed 18 assists and 11 goals in the Bundesliga, and Hummels has established himself as leader at the freshly crowned German Cup winners Borussia Dortmund, forcing Löw into a U-turn.

“We want a team bubbling with ambition and passion,” Löw said. “A team that gives everything on the pitch to be successful. That is our aim and you can feel it in the team that it wants to be successful at this tournament.”

Löw also included the Monaco striker Kevin Volland, who has not played for Germany since 2016, and the Bayern Munich teenager Jamal Musiala, who earned his first call-up in March after pledging his international future to Germany rather than England. Freiburg’s defender Christian Günter also surprisingly made the cut, hoping to add to his only cap from 2014.

Germany are in Group F with Hungary, the holders Portugal and France, and play their group matches in Munich. “I have not yet set a goal for the tournament,” said Löw. “This time we don’t belong to the absolute favourites like France, for example, but this is not necessarily a burden … If we get through the group and get into a flow then my team can achieve anything.”

But an overhaul interrupted by the pandemic failed to yield tangible results as the team crashed to their biggest competitive defeat – a 6-0 loss to Spain – as recently as last November.</p>

<p>“You can interrupt an overhaul under the circumstances,” Löw said on Wednesday. “In the defence we did not have the desired stability recently and … experience may have been missing in some games.</p>

<p>“Mats is a player who influences other players and brings experience,” said Löw, who also praised Müller’s superb season with Bayern Munich. Müller has managed 18 assists and 11 goals in the Bundesliga, and Hummels has established himself as leader at the freshly crowned German Cup winners Borussia Dortmund, forcing Löw into a U-turn.</p>

<p>“We want a team bubbling with ambition and passion,” Löw said. “A team that gives everything on the pitch to be successful. That is our aim and you can feel it in the team that it wants to be successful at this tournament.”</p>

<p>Löw also included the Monaco striker Kevin Volland, who has not played for Germany since 2016, and the Bayern Munich teenager Jamal Musiala, who earned his first call-up in March after pledging his international future to Germany rather than England. Freiburg’s defender Christian Günter also surprisingly made the cut, hoping to add to his only cap from 2014.</p>

<p>Germany are in Group F with Hungary, the holders Portugal and France, and play their group matches in Munich. “I have not yet set a goal for the tournament,” said Löw. “This time we don’t belong to the absolute favourites like France, for example, but this is not necessarily a burden … If we get through the group and get into a flow then my team can achieve anything.”</p>

A joint investigation by Police Scotland and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service has found three vehicles were deliberately set alight, which also resulted in extensive damage to the garage.

Detectives are treating the fire as deliberate after CCTV showed a man pouring an accelerant on the vehicles. The male suspect is described as around 5ft 10in and of slim build. He was wearing black joggers, a black hooded jumper with the hood up, black trainers and a face mask. A silver or grey hatchback car was also seen near the house at the time of the fire. Detective Inspector Susie Cairns said: “This was a completely reckless act which destroyed three cars and caused significant damage to the property’s garage.

“The consequences could have been so much worse but thankfully nobody was injured during this incident.”

A Celtic spokesman said: “We can confirm that significant damage has been caused to Peter Lawwell’s house and vehicles there, following an explosion and fire early this morning, forcing the family to leave the property.

“Clearly, Peter’s family are extremely shaken and shocked by these terrible events, but thankfully all are safe.

“We understand that Police Scotland are currently undertaking a criminal investigation.

“Peter and his family will of course receive the full support and care of everyone at the club.”","<article>

Perhaps the following should be presented without comment: Arsenal are timing their run towards the Europa Conference League to perfection. They have won four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2018 and will not mind that this defeat of Crystal Palace, who deserved to honour the retiring Roy Hodgson with a win, came via their only three shots on target.

Mikel Arteta’s team had hardly threatened in the second half when, in added time, Gabriel Martinelli ghosted onto a cross from his fellow substitute Martin Ødegaard and converted scruffily. Nicolas Pépé, whose superb opener had been cancelled out by Christian Benteke, still had time to score an equally outstanding third and set up a final day that now feels alive with possibility.

At kick-off the sun had shone above Selhurst Park, a rarity for this particular month, and the stars had aligned too. Hodgson’s farewell would take place to a crowd of around 6,500; an emotional return met with a poignant departure, and the guard of honour with which both sides greeted the retiring manager onto the pitch must have meant so much more when accompanied by a resounding chorus of “he’s one of our own”.

During Hodgson’s tenure, Palace have understood how to give Arsenal a game. They had won one and drawn five of the teams’ previous six encounters: getting in those games and staying them, that record perhaps summing up the consistency and redoubtable quality Hodgson has instilled. This time Palace were shorn of Eberechi Eze, whose exceptional creativity will be missed for several months due to an achilles injury, but the pattern of previous years was largely unaltered until Pépé scored with Arsenal’s first genuine chance.

It was marvellously worked, Kieran Tierney slipping a pass to Bukayo Saka and then making a run inside the winger, who located him with a chopped backheel. Tierney could size up a cross from near the byline and Pépé, arriving to meet the delivery at waist-height near the penalty spot, executed an expertly-controlled volley with his right foot.

For a snapshot of Arteta’s Arsenal at their best it will take some beating. They had threatened down the flanks during the previous 35 minutes but Palace, as so often, held firm in central areas. The hosts might have felt regret that they were not ahead: James Tomkins had worked Bernd Leno with a firm header midway through the half and shortly afterwards Benteke, rising at the far post to meet Andros Townsend’s deep free-kick, thudded off target when he could quite feasibly have scored.

Before Pépé’s goal there was still time for Leno to make an exceptional save, sprawling leftwards to tip Jeffrey Schlupp’s deflected volley wide. As with most of the games played to returning crowds this week there was a distinct edge to many of the challenges, not to mention the reactions to them. There was rancour when Benteke clashed off the ball with Mohamed Elneny, both players receiving bookings even though the former had appeared to glance his opponent’s face with an elbow.

It was inevitable, then, that Benteke should inflict an even more telling blow just after the hour. He had missed another header within seconds of the restart so this was third time lucky and, for Arsenal’s defence, a costly moment of inattention. Palace had struggled to get going since the interval but, when Townsend sized up another left-sided free-kick, rightly sensed another opportunity. The delivery was, not for the first time, perfect and an unmarked Benteke gave Leno no chance this time. His firm, stooping finish was validated by VAR, which ruled he had neither strayed offside nor committed a foul on Elneny in escaping the Arsenal back line.

Now Palace’s tails were back up and Leno had to smother at close quarters when Benteke, oozing confidence and seeking a fifth goal in four games, sought to bustle through at a tight angle. With 15 minutes left Calum Chambers thwarted Wilfried Zaha and the frustration for Arsenal was that, with some kind of positive resolution to their season still available, they were hardly battering the door. The Palace substitute Jordan Ayew came close but then, against all logic, Martinelli provided a sucker punch. Before the whistle, Pépé weaved through stylishly and made sure. – Guardian","<article>

Tottenham provided further evidence why Harry Kane might think he needs to leave to be successful after an abject display in a 2-1 loss to Aston Villa which severely hurts their Europa League chances.

Kane has reportedly told the club he wants to be sold this summer and there is no surprise as this performance shows how far Spurs have fallen in recent years.

A top-six finish is now out of their hands as after Steven Bergwijn’s first goal of the season put them in front early on they capitulated, with Sergio Reguilon scoring an own goal and then being culpable for Ollie Watkins’ winner.

They will go to Leicester on the final day of the season and likely have to win and hope that West Ham drop points at home to Southampton after they fluffed their lines.

It was perhaps befitting of a disappointing campaign that the return of 10,000 fans was greeted by one of the worst performances and they were left booing their team off at the end of the match.

Even Kane, so often the man Spurs could rely on, was a no-show and if this does prove to be his final home game as a Tottenham player — which is by no means certain — he will certainly have regrets.

Everton 1 Wolverhampton Wanderers 0

Everton ended a miserable run of home form to keep their slim hopes of European football alive and give 6,500 returning fans something to cheer about as they edged out Wolves 1-0 at Goodison Park.

Richarlison’s 48th-minute header separated the sides on the night, giving Everton a first home win in six and only a second win in 10, though it was not one that came easily.

Coupled with Tottenham’s home defeat to Aston Villa, the win keeps Everton in the mix for Europa League football, although a far inferior goal difference and final-day trip to Manchester City still leaves them as outsiders.

Everton began the night with only five home wins all season, two of those coming in December when 2,000 fans were allowed in to back-to-back wins over Arsenal and Chelsea, and the returning faithful helped them complete their first league double over Wolves in 45 years.

Newcastle United 1 Sheffield United 0

Joe Willock was urged to make his stay at Newcastle permanent after he scored in a sixth successive Premier League game to hand the Magpies victory over Sheffield United.

On a night when Allan Saint-Maximin turned in a virtuoso performance to mesmerise the relegated Blades’ defence, the 10,000 members of the Toon Army allowed into St James’ Park for the first time since February last year implored the 21-year-old Arsenal loanee in song to make Tyneside his home next season.

They also made their feelings clear about owner Mike Ashley and the Premier League as the club’s takeover saga rumbles on, but in the main they celebrated a 1-0 win which took the club to 42 points, two fewer than they managed last season with a game to go.","<article>

Almost unanimously, they voted against.

But three years later, the three-time Dublin All-Ireland winner, David Hickey, became their first foreign player.

Critically, Jacques Larroze, the owner of a local fishing company and a former fullback, had become the club’s new president.

“He was more liberal and more interested in changing the image of La Rochelle,” explains Richard Escot, a long-standing rugby writer with L’Équipe who hails from La Rochelle.

Larroze enlisted the French TV commentator Pierre Salviac to help find their first foreigner. He contacted Ollie Campbell, who in turn contacted a team-mate on Belvedere’s 1972 Leinster Schools Senior Cup winning team, Michael Hickey, who in turn mentioned it to his older brother David, then a medical student.

Hickey had subscribed to the monthly French rugby journal Miroir du Rugby.

“I loved French rugby in the 60s and 70s and it’s nice to see Fabien Galthie bringing French rugby back in that direction because it had been appalling to watch for the last 10 or 15 years.”

Hickey had played with Clontarf and UCD previously, and Dublin’s run of six successive All-Ireland finals under Kevin Heffernan had come to an end with defeat by Offaly in the Leinster Championship. La Rochelle also found him work in a local hospital for the first year and in Bordeaux for his second season.

“I had the advantage of being very fit moving into their pre-season and the rest is history. Everyone had very long memories and they never forgot an injustice or an injury, so it was pretty violent, just like playing Gaelic football, so I felt very at home,” he says laughing.

“You could have a 30-point win at home one weekend and the next weekend you could lose by the same amount. The referees gave the away teams nothing.”

As a fullback he also had full licence to counterattack.

Although he will support La Rochelle in the Heineken Champions Cup final at Twickenham on Saturday (kick-off 4.45pm and live on Virgin Media, Channel 4 and BT Sport) he has a fondness for Toulouse dating back to a 9-9 draw against Jean-Pierre Rives et al in the Yves du Manoir tournament in 1981.

“Toulouse were always a superior club in that they never resorted to violence, almost uniquely. Our own boys were rough enough but if you played down in Toulon, Carcassone or Aurillac, it could be frightening.

“But then the meal after the match was a huge event and the players were experts in the different wines in the different regions, and they’d talk for hours about the foie gras.

“If I hadn’t been a medical graduate I would have stayed in France and run a bar or a restaurant or a gym, something like that, and lived happily ever after. Maybe it’s not too late.”

On returning to Ireland he was placed in Waterford, and played for a year with Waterpark where his father Patrick had played.

To mark Hickey’s farewell, La Rochelle hosted a Clontarf side featuring three Irish international guests, the aforementioned Campbell, Donal Spring and Terry Kennedy, in May 1982.

Clontarf won and the next day they took part in an eight-a-side tournament on the island of Île de Ré.

“As you can imagine we weren’t exactly in great shape for it,” recalls Spring. “Having been hammered in the pool stages by the La Rochelle ‘B’ the playoffs were late enough in the afternoon to have recovered and we managed to beat the ‘A’ team in the semi-final and the ‘B’ team in the final with Terry Kennedy getting man of the match.

“The players all got a box of oysters as their prize which we duly gave away to people in the crowd and then got the boat back to La Rochelle and had another good evening,” says Spring, who played for the next two seasons with Bagnéres after qualifying as a solicitor.

He describes Hickey as a great rugby player.

“He was just a very good footballer, very strong and had all the skills. He was very highly spoken of in La Rochelle and very popular. In France, as a foreign player, you’re either fully accepted or you’re rejected, there’s no half-way house.”

Escot concurs. “When you say the name of David Hickey in La Rochelle everybody has a smile and a good story about him.”

Ex team-mates even formed a Celtic Club in Châtelaillon, a seaport town just south of La Rochelle.

“It celebrates celtic culture in the local area, dance, music, rugby and Guinness, and also Gaelic football,” says Escot.

Four years ago, several of them visited Dublin for the All-Ireland final, when Dublin drew with Mayo, Hickey acting as ticket provider and host.

As one of the world’s leading transplant surgeons, Hickey’s work has also taken him to Bahrain, Sudan, Egypt and latterly Dubai, but mostly to Cuba.

“I have been going there for about 25 years. My late wife was Cuban. I always admired them in the Olympics, their dignity and their sense of country. [Teófilo] Stevenson and these guys never took the big bucks in the United States,” Hickey says in reference to the famed triple Olympic gold medallist.

“We used to go for three months every year when my wife, Yamile, was alive. She was a neuro-surgeon and she worked there for three months every year.”

“When I went there I wasn’t disappointed on any level. The humanity of the place is enormous. They have alleviated poverty essentially. Nobody is rich but there’s nobody without a home, an education or health care.

“My mother-in-law is staying with me at the moment and what she misses most about Cuba is her free morning Tai Chi lessons in the local park. It’s actually a more developed society than America’s or our own one by default. It’s the fourth world rather than the third world, potentially the future for a lot of people I think.”

Hickey, who now works part-time in the Mater Hospital, has been helping his son David study for the Leaving Cert after what has been a tough year and a half. In January last year he and David flew back from Cuba and the night they returned home received a phone call from Havana to inform them that Yamile had died in a drowning accident, meaning a cruelly swift return the next day for her funeral.

Sport has been a welcome release for him during the various lockdowns and Hickey accepts he was probably the only Dubliner to support La Rochelle in the semi-final against Leinster. To his regret, he has only found time for one return visit to his old French club.

“I would love to have been in La Rochelle for that semi-final. I do intend this summer, if things open up, to drive down to La Rochelle with my young fella and meet up with the La Rochelle boys and the celtic club in Châtelaillon!”","<article>

<p>La Rochelle may have a fair sprinkling of top-level foreign players in their ranks nowadays but back in 1977 they held a vote to decide whether they would allow All Blacks legend <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Graham+Mourie"">Graham Mourie</a> to join the club. Almost unanimously, they voted against.</p>

<p>But three years later, the three-time Dublin All-Ireland winner, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=David+Hickey"">David Hickey</a>, became their first foreign player.</p>

<p>Critically, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Jacques+Larroze"">Jacques Larroze</a>, the owner of a local fishing company and a former fullback, had become the club’s new president.</p>

<p>“He was more liberal and more interested in changing the image of La Rochelle,” explains <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Richard+Escot"">Richard Escot</a>, a long-standing rugby writer with L’Équipe who hails from La Rochelle.</p>

<p>Larroze enlisted the French TV commentator <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Pierre+Salviac"">Pierre Salviac</a> to help find their first foreigner. He contacted <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Ollie+Campbell"">Ollie Campbell</a>, who in turn contacted a team-mate on Belvedere’s 1972 Leinster Schools Senior Cup winning team, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Michael+Hickey"">Michael Hickey</a>, who in turn mentioned it to his older brother David, then a medical student.</p>

<p>Hickey had subscribed to the monthly French rugby journal Miroir du Rugby.</p>

<p>“I loved French rugby in the 60s and 70s and it’s nice to see <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Fabien+Galthie"">Fabien Galthie</a> bringing French rugby back in that direction because it had been appalling to watch for the last 10 or 15 years.”</p>

<p>Hickey had played with Clontarf and UCD previously, and Dublin’s run of six successive All-Ireland finals under <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kevin+Heffernan"">Kevin Heffernan</a> had come to an end with defeat by Offaly in the Leinster Championship. La Rochelle also found him work in a local hospital for the first year and in Bordeaux for his second season.</p>

<p>“I had the advantage of being very fit moving into their pre-season and the rest is history. Everyone had very long memories and they never forgot an injustice or an injury, so it was pretty violent, just like playing Gaelic football, so I felt very at home,” he says laughing.</p>

<p>“You could have a 30-point win at home one weekend and the next weekend you could lose by the same amount. The referees gave the away teams nothing.”</p>

<p>As a fullback he also had full licence to counterattack.</p>

<p>Although he will support La Rochelle in the Heineken Champions Cup final at Twickenham on Saturday (kick-off 4.45pm and live on Virgin Media, Channel 4 and BT Sport) he has a fondness for Toulouse dating back to a 9-9 draw against Jean-Pierre Rives et al in the Yves du Manoir tournament in 1981.</p>

<p>“Toulouse were always a superior club in that they never resorted to violence, almost uniquely. Our own boys were rough enough but if you played down in Toulon, Carcassone or Aurillac, it could be frightening.</p>

<p>“But then the meal after the match was a huge event and the players were experts in the different wines in the different regions, and they’d talk for hours about the foie gras.</p>

<p>“If I hadn’t been a medical graduate I would have stayed in France and run a bar or a restaurant or a gym, something like that, and lived happily ever after. Maybe it’s not too late.”</p>

<p>On returning to Ireland he was placed in Waterford, and played for a year with Waterpark where his father Patrick had played.</p>

<p>To mark Hickey’s farewell, La Rochelle hosted a Clontarf side featuring three Irish international guests, the aforementioned Campbell, <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Donal+Spring"">Donal Spring</a> and <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Terry+Kennedy"">Terry Kennedy</a>, in May 1982.</p>

<p>Clontarf won and the next day they took part in an eight-a-side tournament on the island of Île de Ré.</p>

<p>“As you can imagine we weren’t exactly in great shape for it,” recalls Spring. “Having been hammered in the pool stages by the La Rochelle ‘B’ the playoffs were late enough in the afternoon to have recovered and we managed to beat the ‘A’ team in the semi-final and the ‘B’ team in the final with Terry Kennedy getting man of the match.</p>

<p>“The players all got a box of oysters as their prize which we duly gave away to people in the crowd and then got the boat back to La Rochelle and had another good evening,” says Spring, who played for the next two seasons with Bagnéres after qualifying as a solicitor.</p>

<p>He describes Hickey as a great rugby player.</p>

<p>“He was just a very good footballer, very strong and had all the skills. He was very highly spoken of in La Rochelle and very popular. In France, as a foreign player, you’re either fully accepted or you’re rejected, there’s no half-way house.”</p>

<p>Escot concurs. “When you say the name of David Hickey in La Rochelle everybody has a smile and a good story about him.”</p>

<p>Ex team-mates even formed a Celtic Club in Châtelaillon, a seaport town just south of La Rochelle.</p>

<p>“It celebrates celtic culture in the local area, dance, music, rugby and Guinness, and also Gaelic football,” says Escot.</p>

<p>Four years ago, several of them visited Dublin for the All-Ireland final, when Dublin drew with Mayo, Hickey acting as ticket provider and host.</p>

<p>As one of the world’s leading transplant surgeons, Hickey’s work has also taken him to Bahrain, Sudan, Egypt and latterly Dubai, but mostly to Cuba.</p>

<p>“I have been going there for about 25 years. My late wife was Cuban. I always admired them in the Olympics, their dignity and their sense of country. [Teófilo] Stevenson and these guys never took the big bucks in the United States,” Hickey says in reference to the famed triple Olympic gold medallist.</p>

<p>“We used to go for three months every year when my wife, Yamile, was alive. She was a neuro-surgeon and she worked there for three months every year.”</p>

<p>“When I went there I wasn’t disappointed on any level. The humanity of the place is enormous. They have alleviated poverty essentially. Nobody is rich but there’s nobody without a home, an education or health care.</p>

<p>“My mother-in-law is staying with me at the moment and what she misses most about Cuba is her free morning Tai Chi lessons in the local park. It’s actually a more developed society than America’s or our own one by default. It’s the fourth world rather than the third world, potentially the future for a lot of people I think.”</p>

<p>Hickey, who now works part-time in the Mater Hospital, has been helping his son David study for the Leaving Cert after what has been a tough year and a half. In January last year he and David flew back from Cuba and the night they returned home received a phone call from Havana to inform them that Yamile had died in a drowning accident, meaning a cruelly swift return the next day for her funeral.</p>

Once the company had announced in March that it wouldn’t be bidding for any more sports rights, the show was effectively over, but it does break a link with the origins of the GAA’s policy on the use of paywalls for its broadcasts.

It was just 15 years ago that Eir’s predecessors Setanta first broadcast national league matches. A subscription channel, it was initially included on the NTL platform, which meant that a large number of subscribers in urban areas, including Dublin, didn’t have to pay for it – unlike those who weren’t NTL customers

Looking back, it’s interesting the extent to which the involvement of Setanta was viewed as less contentious than the acquisition of championship rights by Sky Sports eight years later.

The narrative was one of a young Irish company – which had greatly increased the GAA’s take on its overseas rights – developing a business as opposed to Rupert Murdoch’s Sky conglomerate.

Liam Mulvihill, in his 2006 annual report, welcomed Setanta.

“At the time of writing we are concluding negotiations for a new three-year contract with RTÉ and TG4, which will give them the vast bulk of our games, but Setanta Sport will be coming on board as well and I am sure they will bring a vitality and a new approach to the coverage of our games.

“Their arrival as a dedicated sports channel is to be welcomed and may well impact significantly on the future of sports television broadcasting for all sports in this country.”

At first, only football matches were covered. This was because floodlights were a comparative rarity in grounds – Croke Park at that stage didn’t even have them – and only Parnell Park in Dublin, Páirc Uí Rinn in Cork and Austin Stack Park in Tralee had lights installed.

Facilities

At the time there was a reason why all hurling league fixtures were confined to TG4’s coverage on Sundays. Cork was the only Division One county with the facilities.

“My understanding is that no team would play Cork under lights, as Cork have played there too often,” said Setanta’s Maurice Reidy at the time. “That’s one of the reasons we don’t have hurling. All our matches are from Division One A of the football league because that’s where the floodlit grounds are, but, come spring 2007, there’ll be a greater variety of venues available.”

The first fixture broadcast by Setanta was Kerry-Mayo on February 1st, 2006. Hurling duly followed.

There were flashpoints along the way. When Croke Park unveiled its floodlights a year later so that the first floodlit action would actually be a GAA fixture rather than the imminent rugby internationals, there was complaint that only Setanta viewers would have access.

The association explained that Setanta had done a deal for league matches that would be honoured. RTÉ maintained that a general-audience terrestrial channel couldn’t stray that far into niche broadcasting on a Saturday evening.

RTÉ’s change of heart has been evident in the past couple of years – to the point where not alone national league fixtures but county championship matches were considered suitable programming on Saturday nights.

That these were broadcast by RTÉ at all gave a hint of what was coming for Eir Sports, which had acquired Setanta in 2016.

The media rights agreement is up for negotiation but, even towards the end of the current agreement, concluded for 2017, there were signs that Eir Sports was looking to cut its losses, agreeing to let its box-office league matches, such as Dublin-Kerry and Limerick-Tipperary this season, go out simultaneously on RTÉ to defray costs.

Similarly, when the station’s deal to take club matches not reserved by TG4 was let slide in the past two years, RTÉ stepped in.

The GAA remains sanguine that the departure of Eir Sports won’t impact on the market for its media rights, worth more than €15 million a year under the current deal.

Recaptured

The reawakened interest in sports rights in RTÉ, which has recently recaptured a share of the Six Nations championship, previously lost to Virgin, and is expected to announce the acquisition of further rugby rights to the Pro 14 championship, reflects the strengths of the station in sports and current affairs.

During the summer Gaelic games is a staple of the schedules even if the evolving GAA championship window promises to be smaller.

There is also the diminishing role of traditional television. Streaming apps can now be watched on a big screen and last summer’s pandemic-disrupted summer was a revelation in terms of the market for small-scale matches and the adaptation of the technology. It was also noted that there were no complaints at having to pay to view these fixtures.

The subscription model is no longer quite so dominant, and there is increasingly access to “skinny bundles” that allow viewers to make short-term commitments for specific matches or competitions – services such as Now TV, offering convenience and accessibility.

Thirty years ago, the GAA’s media rights involved just one partner, RTÉ, which also held overseas rights. That was hived off, with Chrysalis taking over the latter. The new rights agreement will involve an abundance of partners and packages in which digital will be increasingly prominent.

Traditional television rights are the centrepiece of the single most lucrative element, but are these days confined to Ireland and the UK. You’d be hard put to catch football and hurling on television anywhere else in the globe, but the success of GAAGO, the streaming service venture between RTÉ and Croke Park which is now seven years old, is a reminder that technology is changing everything in this, as in other, sectors.","<article>

Set for the Mary Peters Track in Belfast on Saturday week, May 29th, a European permit was originally awarded last December, after an application by meeting director Eamonn Christie, the long-serving athletics coach in Belfast who previously worked with the likes of Ciara Mageean.

In recent weeks, however, it emerged that application had to be supported by Athletics Ireland, and not just signed off on their behalf by Christie, along with Michael McGovern of the Irish Milers Club. Christie openly admits the error, which resulted in European Athletics revoking the permit having been contacted by Athletics Ireland, although the re-granting of that permit is still possible with Athletics Ireland support.

“I will certainly hold my hands up on that, call it my inexperience, or my naivety, but I didn’t realise I had to go through the national federation,” Christie told The Irish Times. “I’ve made them [Athletics Ireland] well aware of that. And I did eat humble pie, I did apologise, writing them a couple of emails, begging them not to stop the permit.”

In response to the matter, Athletics Ireland did issue a short statement on Thursday afternoon: “Athletics Ireland only became aware of the Belfast Irish Milers Meet application for a European Athletics permit recently. European Athletics withdrew their permit for this Meet due to administrative concerns.”

Several Irish Tokyo contenders are still set to compete, including Phil Healy in the 200m, Mark English in the 800m, Andrew Coscoran and Paul Robinson in the 1,500m, along with emerging distance running talents such as Cian McPhillips, Luke McCann and John Fitzsimons. A special invite has also been extended to the Irish women’s 4x200m squad of Aoife Lynch, Kate Doherty, Sarah Quinn and Sophie Becker, who finished second in the event at the recent World Athletics Relays.

The meeting still has a UK level two permit, which means any Tokyo qualifying time, underage record, etc will stand: “It’s the extra ranking points that most athletes are after at this stage,” said Christie. “Almost all the runners I’ve contacted are still coming, which is reassuring, because we have been preparing for a long time now to put on an excellent track meet, with quality sponsors and we also have prize money.

“Athletics Ireland say they were only made aware of this meeting over the last two weeks, when I’ve been trying to promote this meeting, more than I normally would, trying to get athletes involved, from early March. But there’s no budging them. Even though I do have the permit from Northern Ireland Athletics, which gives me insurance, and I have all the Covid-19 restrictions in place, all the first aid, all that.

“The big thing for me is that they’re denying their own athletes the chance to get ranking points for Tokyo. That’s what this meeting is about, helping our home-grown athletes to get points towards Tokyo qualification. European Athletics are saying to me, even at this stage, that once they sign the form, there’s no problem. There is no deadline, they are saying. But if Athletics Ireland won’t sign the permit, it will be 2022 before they can re-engage on the matter.”","<article>

Canada’s Corey Conners is the leader - he is two strokes clear at the top of the leaderboard following an impressive effort of 67 on a tough day of scoring in south Carolina. Brooks Koepka and Viktor Hovland are among those lurking on three under par, however it was a familiar story for Rory McIlroy who made another slow start in a Major championship. The 32-year-old made three birdies and six bogeys in a rollercoaster round, signing for a disappointing 75 and leaving himself with plenty to do in today’s second round. Shane Lowry meanwhile was left to rue some bad luck on the 17th - his ball plugging in the sand - as he opened with a one over par effort of 73.

Well, as of last week, they have all invested money into Just Women’s Sports, an online platform solely dedicated to the promotion and analysis of women’s sports. In fact, they believe in women’s sports platforms so much, CEO Haley Rosen and her crew received $3.5 million to grow their brand along with the women’s game.

“Our ambition is to really be the one-stop shop for all things women’s sports. That means expanding our digital channels, growing out our audio network. We would love to get into premium content. For us, we want to make the games accessible, we want the games. We have a vision for this company that you go to justwomenssports.com, put in your name, put in your password, and unlock this whole world of women’s sports,” explains Rosen.

Rosen is a former professional soccer player with Washington Spirit and a graduate of Stanford University, where she was named an All-Pac-12 midfielder while playing for Stanford. Now, she devotes her time to Just Women’s Sports.

“I really believe a lot of mainstream sports media is built around men’s sports. If you look at a lot of the major networks in the US, they focus on the NFL, NBA, MLB – these are all men’s sports leagues. They have audiences that are there for men’s sports brands that want to sponsor men’s sports. For us, I think that there’s a real opportunity to go do that and build that for women’s sports and set up a structure that is set up for women’s sports to just dominate and bring in brands that want audiences there for women’s sports.

“Something that I’ve really learned on this journey is I thought initially, hey, here’s your sports fans, and you want to convert a certain percentage over to women’s sports. I do think that’s part of it. We always say if you’re a fan of the Lakers, we want you to be a fan of the Sparks. I think a bigger part of this is this ‘post-Title IX generation’, and it’s a lot of women like myself that grew up playing sports from an amateur to a professional level, and they want to watch the game that they know. Our ambition is to really pull that together, and that’s what I think is really the opportunity here.”

Obvious choice

Someone who also believes in this project is a two-time NBA champion and MVP Durant. Thirty Five Ventures was set up by Durant and his business partner Rich Kleiman. Overseeing his personal brand’s creative content with Thirty Five Ventures is chief marketing officer Sarah Flynn. According to Flynn, the investment was an obvious choice for KD.

“I think anybody who knows and follows Kevin knows how supportive he is of the women’s game and women’s sports in general, but obviously, in particular, the WNBA. If you talk to any NBA player, they see WNBA players as their peers, they watch the games. They understand the physicality and the athleticism, and the style of play and how great female athletes, especially in the WNBA, are at just the fundamentals of basketball. If you are a pure basketball fan, you love the WNBA as much as you do the NBA. To them, it’s just no question,” explains Flynn.

What we have in the women’s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice

So, what was it about Just Women’s Sports that caught the eye of one of basketball’s all-time greats?

“I think when you look at the women’s sports landscape, there are just some fundamental steps that have been skipped in terms of building those conversations and building those fandoms. Again, that’s something that Just Women’s Sports [is] trying to address.

“If you look at where men’s sports are, you’re very used to getting those behind-the-scenes storylines about the athletes... you understand the world and the fashion and the personality and social justice [issues] as well as all of those things around the league... and you can contextualise those things because you understood those people as players first.

“What we have in the women’s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice... you have a lot of people trying to do a lot of storytelling around who the women are as people, but you don’t have enough storytelling about them as the players. You do not see the highlight reels. You’re not seeing the highlights, and all of those fundamentals need to happen before you can truly build engaged fandoms.”

Unique opportunity

In Haley’s eyes, Covid has given women’s sports a unique opportunity, with everyone stuck at home. For a long time, the NWSL was the only league up and running. The WNBA’s season opener saw a 63 per cent increase in viewership.

“We’ve been asking and wanting more coverage, and for whatever reason with Covid, it just became unacceptable to not cover women’s sports. I also think that with sports stopping and the NWSL was literally the only league in the US that was playing, they had a real opportunity, and they took full advantage of it. Then the WNBA did something similar too. I just feel like, with Covid, women’s sports got a real chance. With that chance, it was undeniable that there was an audience and interest there, and that it was a really, really great product,” reiterates Rosen.

According to Flynn, while businesses may be looking for newer opportunities to promote their business, women’s sport is the place to start.

“I think with announcements like ours and people like Kevin stepping up and supporting something like Just Women’s Sports, other people are starting to get a little bit of Fomo, and there’s that ‘we don’t want to miss out on what could be a huge investment. We got to get on the ball now, and we have to start covering the game.’ You feel a little bit of that pressure behind the scenes in a really good and fun way.”

For now, Rosen has her eye on the prize. She knows what she’s looking to do with the investment. “For us, it’s all about building the ecosystem of women’s sports, getting people to tune in every week, every day, and just continuing to build the world of women’s sports. That’s really our goal.”","<article>

<p>Rosen is a former professional soccer player with Washington Spirit and a graduate of <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Stanford+University"">Stanford University</a>, where she was named an All-Pac-12 midfielder while playing for Stanford. Now, she devotes her time to Just Women’s Sports.</p>

<p>“I really believe a lot of mainstream sports media is built around men’s sports. If you look at a lot of the major networks in the US, they focus on the NFL, NBA, MLB – these are all men’s sports leagues. They have audiences that are there for men’s sports brands that want to sponsor men’s sports. For us, I think that there’s a real opportunity to go do that and build that for women’s sports and set up a structure that is set up for women’s sports to just dominate and bring in brands that want audiences there for women’s sports.</p>

<p>“Something that I’ve really learned on this journey is I thought initially, hey, here’s your sports fans, and you want to convert a certain percentage over to women’s sports. I do think that’s part of it. We always say if you’re a fan of the Lakers, we want you to be a fan of the Sparks. I think a bigger part of this is this ‘post-Title IX generation’, and it’s a lot of women like myself that grew up playing sports from an amateur to a professional level, and they want to watch the game that they know. Our ambition is to really pull that together, and that’s what I think is really the opportunity here.”</p>

<h2>Obvious choice</h2>

<p>Someone who also believes in this project is a two-time NBA champion and MVP Durant. Thirty Five Ventures was set up by Durant and his business partner <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Rich+Kleiman"">Rich Kleiman</a>. Overseeing his personal brand’s creative content with Thirty Five Ventures is chief marketing officer <a href=""https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Sarah+Flynn"">Sarah Flynn</a>. According to Flynn, the investment was an obvious choice for KD.</p>

<p>“I think anybody who knows and follows Kevin knows how supportive he is of the women’s game and women’s sports in general, but obviously, in particular, the WNBA. If you talk to any NBA player, they see WNBA players as their peers, they watch the games. They understand the physicality and the athleticism, and the style of play and how great female athletes, especially in the WNBA, are at just the fundamentals of basketball. If you are a pure basketball fan, you love the WNBA as much as you do the NBA. To them, it’s just no question,” explains Flynn.</p>

<blockquote>What we have in the women’s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice</blockquote>

<p>So, what was it about Just Women’s Sports that caught the eye of one of basketball’s all-time greats?</p>

<p>“I think when you look at the women’s sports landscape, there are just some fundamental steps that have been skipped in terms of building those conversations and building those fandoms. Again, that’s something that Just Women’s Sports [is] trying to address.</p>

<p>“If you look at where men’s sports are, you’re very used to getting those behind-the-scenes storylines about the athletes... you understand the world and the fashion and the personality and social justice [issues] as well as all of those things around the league... and you can contextualise those things because you understood those people as players first.</p>

<p>“What we have in the women’s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice... you have a lot of people trying to do a lot of storytelling around who the women are as people, but you don’t have enough storytelling about them as the players. You do not see the highlight reels. You’re not seeing the highlights, and all of those fundamentals need to happen before you can truly build engaged fandoms.”</p>

<h2>Unique opportunity</h2>

<p>In Haley’s eyes, Covid has given women’s sports a unique opportunity, with everyone stuck at home. For a long time, the NWSL was the only league up and running. The WNBA’s season opener saw a 63 per cent increase in viewership.</p>

<p>“We’ve been asking and wanting more coverage, and for whatever reason with Covid, it just became unacceptable to not cover women’s sports. I also think that with sports stopping and the NWSL was literally the only league in the US that was playing, they had a real opportunity, and they took full advantage of it. Then the WNBA did something similar too. I just feel like, with Covid, women’s sports got a real chance. With that chance, it was undeniable that there was an audience and interest there, and that it was a really, really great product,” reiterates Rosen.</p>

<p>According to Flynn, while businesses may be looking for newer opportunities to promote their business, women’s sport is the place to start.</p>

<p>“I think with announcements like ours and people like Kevin stepping up and supporting something like Just Women’s Sports, other people are starting to get a little bit of Fomo, and there’s that ‘we don’t want to miss out on what could be a huge investment. We got to get on the ball now, and we have to start covering the game.’ You feel a little bit of that pressure behind the scenes in a really good and fun way.”</p>

<p>For now, Rosen has her eye on the prize. She knows what she’s looking to do with the investment. “For us, it’s all about building the ecosystem of women’s sports, getting people to tune in every week, every day, and just continuing to build the world of women’s sports. That’s really our goal.”</p>

The moment news leaked of his impending retirement as the voice of the NBA, he was being routinely described as an icon, a legend, one of the most storied broadcasters ever.

In the 58 years that have passed since he called his first New York Knicks’ game at just 21, Albert became synonymous with the sport, his distinctive catchphrases segueing from the court into popular culture. The only jarring note was that quite a few paeans to his longevity somehow didn’t see fit to mention his starring role in an especially lurid sexual assault case.

In May 1997, he was charged with forcible sodomy, biting a long-time lover multiple times on the back, and then forcing her to perform oral sex on him in a Virginia hotel room. According to the testimony of Vanessa Perhach, Albert was angry because, while he’d been busy working the Knicks versus the Washington Bullets, she had failed to find another man to join them that evening for a threesome.

In the months between his arrest and the start of his trial, his name also turned up in the black book of Mistress Hilda Pierce, a New York city dominatrix who was mysteriously shot dead in her Upper West Side apartment.

Born Marvin Aufrichtig into a Hungarian family in Brooklyn, he got a job running errands for the Dodgers at 14, just before they alighted to Los Angeles. There followed a stint as a ball boy for the Knicks where he eventually became statistician to Marty Glickman, the famed commentator who got stuck in a blizzard one night in the winter of 1963 and sent word the kid now known as Marv Albert should take his mike for a game against the Celtics. He went on to cover umpteen Super Bowls, Stanley Cup finals, World Series. major boxing fights, and even Wimbledon.

His schedule was so over-packed that he titled his autobiography (ghosted by Rick Reilly), “I’d Love To, But I Have a Game . . . ”, the sentence he trotted out most to friends and family when explaining his absences. Then, at the peak of his career, he sent a text to Perhach, asking, “When are we going to meet? Got somebody to take the tickets? And, oh, by the way, do you have somebody for the threesome?”

Suddenly, he was holding press conferences protesting his innocence and declaring the encounter to have been entirely consensual. The prosecution was requesting impressions of his teeth, legal experts were pointing out the maximum sentence he faced was life, and, through it all, his various employers stood resolutely by him as he awaited his day in court.

The proceedings began with an opening statement from the prosecution that included allegations Albert regularly beseeched Perhach to bring women’s underwear for him to don during their encounters. On day two, she took the stand herself and told of his frequent requests to find men with large penises to join their fun. Salacious tabloid fodder that was not damning evidence of anything but his rather eclectic attitude in the bedroom. Then, in the best traditions of every courthouse drama, the prosecution sprung a surprise witness on the third day.

Patricia Masten was a concierge with Hyatt Hotels who testified about being invited to Albert’s suite one time in Texas to assist him sending a fax. When she got there, he emerged from the bathroom dressed in women’s panties and a garter belt and forced himself on her. As she struggled under the attack, Albert started to bite her. Trying to wrestle free, she grabbed his toupee, lifting it clean off his head. At which point, clutching the wig, he ran from the room and she made good her escape.

Amid speculation about whether his hairdresser might be called down from New York to testify about how the peculiar application of his rug made ripping it off impossible, Albert struck a deal the very next day. He pled guilty to assault and battery while the more serious felony charge of forcible sodomy was dropped.

Reputation rehab

“In the past, there was consensual biting,” said Albert, before the judge sentenced him to 12 months suspended, a $2,500 fine and psychological counselling. “On this particular evening, I did not realise until her testimony that she felt she was harmed. For that I am sorry.”

Initially fired from the airwaves, Albert’s stay in professional purgatory was obscenely brief. Within weeks, a series of soft-focus media appearances began his reputation rehab. On “60 Minutes” with Barbara Walters, he denied large portions of the case against him and called Perhach a liar. On “The David Letterman Show” where he was a guest over 50 times, he declared the whole thing a set-up, motivated by his jealous accuser being aggrieved that he was marrying another woman.

“Man!” joked Letterman. “Wow! The only thing I’ve bitten during sex is my lower lip.”

The audience lapped up the old pals’ double act, guffawing throughout a 20-minute cameo spent downplaying the assault and disparaging Perhach. The contrived public relations blitz worked a treat. By the start of the next basketball season, Albert was back calling New York Knicks’ games and, six months later, he returned to national television. As with so much of the fulsome praise of his career this past few days, it was like nothing untoward ever happened.","<article>

This was the venue for the Sound Running Track Meet, nestled somewhere beneath the Californian hills, all hidden away from any curious onlookers or anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the best American runners around. Plus a few internationals who have been training in one of the many altitude training camp locations around the US.

In other ways there was an aura about the place, an opportunity and event that athletes felt they would miss out on if they simply don’t come.

Altitude training seems to be essential these days, with athletes training in Park City, Utah, Flagstaff, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to name a few. US athletes don’t think much of dropping down for a race to test themselves, but also to check their progress, as many are aiming for the US Olympic trials in just one month’s time at the newly renovated Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon – which will also host the World Athletics Championships in 2022.

I’m based in Park City with a group of Nike-sponsored athletes, and we made the trek to Irvine the afternoon before the 1,500 metres and 800 metre races were scheduled to take part.

There were a couple of 10,000 metres on the Friday night, with athletes urgently chasing Olympic qualifying standards, and also US athletes having to meet Olympic trial entry standards.

The Sound Running Track Meet is an independent race series that attracts athletes of all levels from high school runners to Olympic champions, and everyone is treated equally. Everyone must pay their entry fee, organise their own travel, accommodation and transfers between airport and hotel and track.

Logistical measures

When you are used to the luxury of similar events in Europe, where athletes have all these logistical measures taken care of, it seems even more of an ordeal for athletes to travel from all over the US just to get the opportunity to race in an environment with perfect conditions. All the races are seeded, with pace-makers aiming for specific times to help get the races under way.

Sonia O’Sullivan: Back at Nike HQ there’s more than sit-ups between runs

You can also understand why these are not races where athletes just run around for the win, but come with purpose and determination to deliver a positive result early season. No longer are the early season races a place to come and awaken the competitive juices; they are a place where you need to be ready to run fast from the start.

I’ve previously watched these Sound Running events online from Australia in 2020 when there were even fewer race opportunities for athletes. I was curious about what it was that drew the athletes to these micro meets.

There was the added requirement of a negative Covid test result or proof of full vaccination to be submitted online within seven days of the event so you could get your name on the list. Athletes warming up and racing were exempt from wearing a mask until they were finished their events.

We left Park City at 1pm; the travel was five hours door-to-door including the one-hour time difference. The most stressful part was the line to get through security, since our last flight two weeks ago the passenger numbers at US airports have exploded. Just when I was getting used to that free middle seat, there is not an empty seat on the plane.

It was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times

The pre-race jog and strides were completed earlier in the morning at the Park City High School track, just dinner and sleep required before the morning races that began at 11am.

It’s unusual for a track meet to have a morning schedule, but the event was shown live on ESPN, and getting national TV coverage is a huge bonus for track and field in America; it probably helped that it’s an Olympic year.

As much as I was expecting the energy of a big track meet due to the calibre of athletes in attendance, it was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times.

The world of athletics has changed so much in recent years, and it seems times are all that matter. It’s nice to win, but these are not the important races; these are races with the main purpose to deliver a time that helps the athlete progress to the next level and then make the cut, as only so many can be selected to run in Tokyo this summer.

You really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd

There was some prize money, partially funded by the livestream which had a pay-per-view, hoping to attract more viewers in the knowledge that they were contributing to the prize pool.

The loud music filled the silence between races but when the music was stopped you could hear a pin drop. You could hear the athletes’ spikes sticking to the track and the breathing as athletes pushed themselves, finding some reward for all the hours and weeks of training. It may seem like early season but things are about to ramp up, with meet after meet appearing on the calendar not just here but across Europe.

You really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd. This felt like an audience of well-informed athletics anoraks, assessing the form and weighing things up for more important races down the track.

Just six weeks to the Olympic qualifying deadline, the US Olympic trials, which normally attract Olympic-size crowds, will be a more subdued affair this year for the fans. But for the athletes it will be no less important, where everything is on the line for those top-three spots. Most countries will have their national championships also in June and teams will be selected – and then the logistics of how the Tokyo Olympics will be played out will become more of a reality.

There is an obvious shift in the times athletes are running. In this one meet alone, there’s a world leading time, national records, personal bests, and qualifying times, but you do wonder how the races will play out in the Olympics when there are qualifying rounds and medals at stake. Will the lap times be so consistent, allowing greater spread of energy across the length of the race, or will there be a return to more tactical racing? It’s never easy to predict because to take on a race also takes bravery.","<article>

<p>There was something of that oft-quoted line from Field of Dreams around the small stadium track at Crean Lutheran High School track in Irvine, California, last weekend: If you build it, they will come.</p>

<p>This was the venue for the Sound Running Track Meet, nestled somewhere beneath the Californian hills, all hidden away from any curious onlookers or anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the best American runners around. Plus a few internationals who have been training in one of the many altitude training camp locations around the US.</p>

<p>In other ways there was an aura about the place, an opportunity and event that athletes felt they would miss out on if they simply don’t come.</p>

<p>Altitude training seems to be essential these days, with athletes training in Park City, Utah, Flagstaff, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to name a few. US athletes don’t think much of dropping down for a race to test themselves, but also to check their progress, as many are aiming for the US Olympic trials in just one month’s time at the newly renovated Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon – which will also host the World Athletics Championships in 2022.</p>

<p>I’m based in Park City with a group of Nike-sponsored athletes, and we made the trek to Irvine the afternoon before the 1,500 metres and 800 metre races were scheduled to take part.</p>

<p>There were a couple of 10,000 metres on the Friday night, with athletes urgently chasing Olympic qualifying standards, and also US athletes having to meet Olympic trial entry standards.</p>

<p>The Sound Running Track Meet is an independent race series that attracts athletes of all levels from high school runners to Olympic champions, and everyone is treated equally. Everyone must pay their entry fee, organise their own travel, accommodation and transfers between airport and hotel and track.</p>

<h2>Logistical measures</h2>

<p>When you are used to the luxury of similar events in Europe, where athletes have all these logistical measures taken care of, it seems even more of an ordeal for athletes to travel from all over the US just to get the opportunity to race in an environment with perfect conditions. All the races are seeded, with pace-makers aiming for specific times to help get the races under way.</p>

<p>You can also understand why these are not races where athletes just run around for the win, but come with purpose and determination to deliver a positive result early season. No longer are the early season races a place to come and awaken the competitive juices; they are a place where you need to be ready to run fast from the start.</p>

<p>I’ve previously watched these Sound Running events online from Australia in 2020 when there were even fewer race opportunities for athletes. I was curious about what it was that drew the athletes to these micro meets.</p>

The Irish Times has delivered top quality news, opinion and analysis since it was first published in 1859. As media technologies evolve, so do our methods of storytelling and delivery. The Irish Times continues the transition from print to multiplatform publication, while upholding the journalistic principles that earned it the reputation as Ireland’s paper of reference.

On this page, you can learn about the principles of The Irish Times, its history and the governing body that guarantees the independence and quality of the newspaper, The Irish Times Trust.

Principles of The Irish Times

The Irish Times upholds the following principles:

The support of constitutional democracy expressed through governments freely elected;
The progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds;
The promotion of a friendly society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values, but free from all religious bias and discrimination;
The promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred, so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour, considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs;
The promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their wellbeing;
In pursuance of the foregoing and to enable readers of The Irish Times to reach informed and independent judgements and to contribute more effectively to the life of the community, the following principles govern the publication of The Irish Times: news shall be as accurate and as comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.

We are the only Irish news organisation with a network of correspondents around the world, who provide a view of the world through Irish eyes.

The Irish Times is the most important national forum for thinkers and doers in Irish society. We offer a platform for critical, constructive and divergent comment in the different spheres including business, politics and public affairs, culture, the environment, health and education. We have moved in recent years from being a newspaper of record to a newspaper of reference.

The Irish Times occupies a special position as a pacemaker for change in the society which it serves. We are prepared to champion specific causes, as we have always done, while recognising that these causes have changed over the past decade. We may present our readers with unpalatable realities on occasions, but we do not employ shock tactics for their own sake. We seek to publish notable stories of contemporary Ireland – the good, the bad, the challenging, the humorous and the inspiring.

We do not go to publication without seeking both sides of the story. And if, in spite of our best efforts, we cannot get one side's version, we make it clear in our report that we have made every reasonable effort to secure that information. We are conscious of our power and responsibility when we deal with issues or events that touch upon the private lives of individuals. We try to act sensitively at times of stress and trauma, and we do not exploit the vulnerability of individuals.

We are scrupulous to quote our sources accurately, but we do not accede to requests from them to vet copy before publication. We will never compromise or reveal a source which has confided in us. We hold fast to this principle whether we face jail or fine or any other pressure.

We are acutely aware that readers of The Irish Times identify with the paper and its website but they do not want to be taken for granted. They want to be informed and then make up their own minds. Fact is sacred, and comment is free. We clearly separate one from the other. Our readers want access to the facts themselves and then they like to accept, or reject, our analysis of what they mean.

Above all else, we commit ourselves to accuracy; the most essential test of our profession. We recognise, of course, that journalism operates in a deadline-driven environment in which mistakes can, and will, happen. When we get it wrong, we say so. Readers can make contact with their representative in the Editor's Office to act on their behalf - seeking corrections or clarifications or explaining why none is warranted, as appropriate.

We welcome readers' views - be it to the Letters to the Editor page; by letter, email or fax. We encourage readers’ participation by way of user generated content, social media posting or comment at the end of an article through irishtimes.com. Readers can also express their views by way of postal or telephoned response to The Irish Times.

We hope our content, particularly original journalism – story, picture, video, the spoken word, data or graphic – plays an essential part in informing and enriching the lives of a growing number of print and digital consumers.

About the Trust

The Irish Times Trust CLG is unique in Ireland. It was set up as ‘a company limited by guarantee’ to purchase The Irish Times Limited and to ensure that The Irish Times would be published as an independent newspaper with specific editorial objectives.

The Trust is regulated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association and controlled by a body of people (the Governors) under company law. It is not a charity and does not have charitable status. It has no beneficial shareholders and it cannot pay dividends. Any profits made by The Irish Times cannot be distributed to the Trust; they must be used to strengthen the newspaper, directly and/or indirectly.

The Trust is composed of a maximum of 11 Governors, who are appointed on the basis that they are ‘representative broadly of the community throughout the whole of Ireland’.

The Trust is a key component in the governance structure of The Irish Times because it guarantees the independence and quality of the newspaper. It is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Company. The primary role of the Trust is to appoint a Board, which is responsible for ensuring that the Company is run successfully and adheres to its core objects. The Trust will intervene only if there is a material threat – financial or otherwise – to the attainment of the main objective of publishing The Irish Times as an independent newspaper. The Company is required to seek Trust approval for significant disposals or acquisitions.

Group structure

In 1974, a Trust was established with the objective of securing and maintaining The Irish Times as ‘an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland, free from any form of personal or party political, commercial, religious or other sectional control’.

This is the core objective set out by the legal document – the Memoranda and Articles of Association – that regulates both The Irish Times Trust CLG (the Trust) and The Irish Times DAC (the Company). The Memorandum and Articles also give substantial protection to The Irish Times against a takeover.

Composed of a maximum of 11 Governors, the Trust is responsible for appointing a Board to ensure that the Company is run successfully and adheres to its core objects. Both the Trust and the Board share the responsibility of ensuring the editorial independence and financial viability of The Irish Times, but they do not interfere with the ordinary activities or decisions (commercial or editorial) of each other. They are differentiated mainly by functions of ownership and operation. In the event of any serious disagreement within the Board, the three directors nominated by the Trust may be deemed to have 50 per cent of all votes plus one. This provision can only come into operation on the basis of legal advice that certifies the matter to be of ‘significant policy’ under the Memorandum and Articles of Association.

<h2>About The Irish Times</h2>

<p>The Irish Times has delivered top quality news, opinion and analysis since it was first published in 1859. As media technologies evolve, so do our methods of storytelling and delivery. The Irish Times continues the transition from print to multiplatform publication, while upholding the journalistic principles that earned it the reputation as Ireland’s paper of reference.</p>

<p>On this page, you can learn about the principles of The Irish Times, its history and the governing body that guarantees the independence and quality of the newspaper, The Irish Times Trust.</p>

<p><strong>Principles of The Irish Times</strong></p>

<p>The Irish Times upholds the following principles:</p>

<ul><li>
		The support of constitutional democracy expressed through governments freely elected;</li>
	<li>
		The progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds;</li>
	<li>
		The promotion of a friendly society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values, but free from all religious bias and discrimination;</li>
	<li>
		The promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred, so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour, considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs;</li>
	<li>
		The promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their wellbeing;</li>
	<li>
		In pursuance of the foregoing and to enable readers of The Irish Times to reach informed and independent judgements and to contribute more effectively to the life of the community, the following principles govern the publication of The Irish Times: news shall be as accurate and as comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.</li></ul>

<p><strong><strong>History of The Irish Times</strong></strong></p>

<ul><li>

	<li>
		<strong>March 29<sup>th</sup>, 1859:</strong> The first edition of The Irish Times is published at No. 4 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1 as a ‘new conservative daily paper’. For 14 weeks, it is published every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.</li>

		<strong>June 8<sup>th</sup>, 1859:</strong> The Irish Times becomes a daily newspaper. It was one of 10 Irish newspapers available at the time, and the only of which that survives to this day.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>1873:</strong> The Arnott family buy The Irish Times following the death of its founder. The paper’s politics shift from Protestant nationalist to unionist.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>1895:</strong> The company moves to D’Olier Street, leading to ‘the Old Lady of D’Olier Street’ moniker.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>1900:</strong> The Irish Times becomes a public company, but the Arnott family continue as majority shareholders until the 1960s.</li>
	<li>

	<li>
		<strong>1974:</strong> A Trust is formed with the objective of securing and maintaining The Irish Times as ‘an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland, free from any form of personal or party political, commercial, religious or other sectional control’.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>1994: </strong>The Irish Times becomes the first newspaper in the British Isles and one of 30 worldwide to establish a website.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>1999:</strong> The Irish Times begins publishing its online edition on ireland.com.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>2006:</strong> The company moves to its current location on Tara Street.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>2008: </strong>The print and online newsrooms are integrated and the website moves from ireland.com to irishtimes.com.</li>
	<li>
		<strong>November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2012:</strong> The new-look Irish Times is launched. Changes to the paper include narrower pages, colour-coded sections, more use of photographs and graphics and more extensive, original journalism. </li></ul>

<h2>Message from the Editor, <strong>Paul O'Neill</strong></h2>

<p>Some 650,000 readers enter into a contract with the journalists of irishtimes.com and The Irish Times newspaper every day. The overriding duty of Irish Times journalists is to those readers. They access our digital content using a variety of devices or buy the newspaper on the understanding that they will be offered journalism of the highest standard; reports that are accurate and comprehensive; and analysis that is informed, fair and based on the facts.</p>

<p>Irish Times journalists face a challenging task every day to live up to the standards set for ourselves and our readers. The Irish Times Trust and its Articles of Association give the newspaper and its website a special position among media organisations by protecting its editorial content from commercial and other sectional interests.</p>

<p>The reputation of The Irish Times is based, first and foremost, on reporting the news. We seek to produce journalism that provides insight, context, explanation, clarity and a unique take on Ireland and on the world – with the highest standards of independence, accuracy, fairness and clarity. We aspire to being a trusted source of information whether it’s in print, on web, mobile or tablet device.</p>

<p>The Irish Times with irishtimes.com is an authoritative and independent commentator and analyst on important events in the affairs of Ireland - North and South - Britain, the European Union, the United States and the wider world. We are the only Irish news organisation with a network of correspondents around the world, who provide a view of the world through Irish eyes.</p>

<p>The Irish Times is the most important national forum for thinkers and doers in Irish society. We offer a platform for critical, constructive and divergent comment in the different spheres including business, politics and public affairs, culture, the environment, health and education. We have moved in recent years from being a newspaper of record to a newspaper of reference.</p>

However, the data does nudge the analysis towards a reasonable starting point when it comes to evaluating team and player contributions.

Reflecting on the season-ending statistics of the recently completed Guinness Pro14 tournament with a view to compiling a team of the season from featured Irish players, this column was immediately struck by how, if any, different that side might be based on personal recollection of performances.

It is never more clearly illustrated than in choosing a fullback. Ulster’s Michael Lowry features prominently in a number of categories relating to attack including “defenders beaten” where he is ranked third (35) across all teams and was an impressive attacking catalyst for his team.

Obviously the number of matches played in the tournament is an important metric when assessing a player’s contribution and primarily for that reason there is a weighting in qualification terms for the most part against Ireland squad members.

Jimmy O’Brien (Leinster), like Lowry, acclimatised beautifully to a less familiar role, but it would be difficult to argue against Mike Haley as the standout Irish player in that position. The Munster fullback enjoyed a brilliant season, a sharp counter-attacking threat to complement his aerial skills. He was at the hub of the province’s better performances en route to the final.

Clean breaks

Taking the wings as a pair, Alex Wootton (Connacht) and Dave Kearney (Leinster) fulfil all the criteria when it comes to stats and performances. Wootton (nine) was one of three players at the top of the tournament try scoring table with Kearney, one behind on eight. Kearney was third (19) in “clean breaks” with Wootton (18) fourth; the same position overall for the Connacht wing (34) in “defenders beaten”.

Going strictly on statistical data, Ulster’s talented young centre Stewart Moore features more prominently than any other centre, but in terms of performances values Connacht’s Tom Daly would be a shoo-in at inside centre, while by the same token James Hume (Ulster) probably deserves the 13 jersey in the putative team.

Jack Carty, Conor Fitzgerald, JJ Hanrahan and Ben Healy all feature prominently across a number of metrics, but Leinster’s Harry Byrne, playing in a largely dominant team, just edges his rivals in employing that specific yardstick, particularly in the playmaking capacity; albeit acknowledging the scope to strongly argue for any of the aforementioned quartet.

In any other season, Luke McGrath’s numbers/performances and ditto for Caolin Blade would make them irresistible candidates at scrumhalf, but Ulster’s John Cooney is unassailable. He was the leading points scorer (115) in the tournament, had the most try assists (13) and made the most clean breaks (22) while a standout player for his team.

Leinster props Peter Dooley and Michael Bent scored three tries apiece, a healthy contribution to supplement their work in more mundane chores, including playing an important role in a dominant Leinster scrum. Bent, who retires at the end of the season, will be missed, the epitome of a team player.

Connacht hooker Shane Delahunt facilitated the most lineout wins (139), Dan Sheehan (Leinster) scored the most tries (six), Kevin O’Byrne (Munster) may have been reincarnated as a hooker from a previous life as an outhalf but according to the statistics James Tracy Leinster) was the most visible across multiple categories.

Injuries to Iain Henderson, Sam Carter, David O’Connor and Cormac Izuchukwu meant that Ulster were forced to rely heavily on Kieran Treadwell and Alan O’Connor, and it is the Skerries man’s durability that made him a strong contender along with Ross Molony, Devin Toner, Jean Kleyn, Billy Holland, Fineen Wycherley and several young aspirants.

Quality candidates

However the body of work offered by Gavin Thornbury and Ultan Dillane is impossible to ignore with the latter consistently excellent and arguably playing as well as he has ever done. Any discussion about the backrow in Irish rugby is oversubscribed in terms of quality candidates.

How can you possibly ignore Ulster’s Nick Timoney, Connacht’s Paul Boyle or Leinster’s Josh Murphy, who were individually outstanding or any one of Sean Reidy, Jordi Murphy, Jack O’Donoghue and Conor Oliver? But there is no room for argument based on the statistics.

Rhys Ruddock, who spent the early part of the season as a number eight, has had to reinforce his mantelpiece based on the number of man-of-the-match accolades while Scott Penny is the co-leading try scorer (nine) in the tournament alongside Wootton and Marcell Coetzee and features in several other categories.

It’s very much the same for Munster number eight Gavin Coombes, whose excellence is likely to be rewarded with a first Ireland cap in the summer as may be the case with Penny.

The team below is largely based on statistical data, except when it is not!
