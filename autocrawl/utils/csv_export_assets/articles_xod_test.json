        "articleBody": "English clubs were responsible for 43 per cent of global transfer activity last summer, according to a Uefa report which lays bare the impact of the pandemic on football.\n\nIt underlines the financial muscle of the Premier League at the end of a season in which Manchester City and Chelsea have reached the Champions League final and Manchester United will contest the Europa League final. The Championship was the sixth-biggest spending league in Europe in 2020-21, outstripping the Portuguese, Dutch and Russian first divisions.\n\nWith head-spinning figures such as a \u20ac7.2 billion loss for Europe\u2019s top-flight clubs since the pandemic began, Uefa concludes that transfer fees and wages \u201cmust be reduced to acceptable levels\u201d if the game is to be restored to financial health.\n\nThe financial losses are stark, with the absence of fans the greatest blow: 210 million fewer clicks of the turnstile cost clubs across Uefa\u2019s 55 member countries \u20ac4bn in revenue, the biggest loss over the period and greater than falls in sponsorship (\u20ac2.7bn) and broadcast revenue (\u20ac1.4bn).\n\nThose losses in turn affected the transfer market. Spending in the 2020 summer window was down 39 per cent on the previous year, and this January\u2019s winter window was down by 56 per cent on 2020. That the summer total was above that of any year before 2014 was down to English clubs.\n\nThe Premier League was by far the biggest spender in 2020-21 with more than \u20ac1.8bn traded, \u20ac600m more than in the next-largest spender, Serie A. The Championship total was \u20ac400m.\n\nSome \u20ac558m went between English clubs but deals sending players from Spain, Germany and France to England were also in the top five most valuable transfer \u201cflows\u201d. This is not likely to continue, however, with Uefa predicting immigration changes brought about by Brexit are likely to lead English clubs to look equally at South America and Africa for recruits.\n\nUefa says reforms to its financial fair play rules are necessary, with controls on costs the key. Ultimately the annual \u201cbenchmarking\u201d report concludes that football is \u201cin essence a very stable business\u201d, however, and that despite the pandemic \u201cclub revenue streams are fundamentally reliable\u201d.\n\nIt does see one existential threat to the game, what it calls the \u201cso-called\u201d European Super League. \u201cA closed breakaway league would destroy value across the whole pyramid,\u201d the report says. \u201cIt is only by respecting the pyramid and the principle of promotion and relegation on sporting merit that European football will be able to continue to grow.\u201d\n\nCritics have argued that Uefa\u2019s reforms to the Champions League undermine the values of sporting merit, with teams able to qualify based on historical performance rather than the position in their domestic league from 2024. Uefa sources say these proposals are subject to possible review.\n\nIn another jab at the ESL, Uefa challenges claims that the breakaway project would have given three times the money Uefa provides to clubs outside the Champions League. Calculating its future solidarity payments at \u20ac28bn compared with the ESL\u2019s \u20ac10bn, the report observes: \u201cNeedless to say, $10bn is not three times $28bn.\u201d\n\nUefa celebrates the ESL\u2019s speedy demise and the \u201cunanimous and resounding uproar\u201d that brought it down. Its end may also have been hastened by an absence of expected support from Fifa.

        "description": "Football\u2019s transformation includes players being a more truthful version of themselves",
        "articleBody": "In protest against Israeli violence in Gaza, Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba and Amad Diallo, and Leicester City\u2019s Hamza Choudhury and Wesley Fofana held up the Palestinian flag following recent matches in the Premier League and FA Cup final.\n\nIt was a bold and challenging gesture to make, especially for Pogba and Diallo. The Manchester United pair work for a club owned by American billionaires, the Glazers. The founding member of the organisation, the late Malcolm Glazer was born in New York, the fifth of seven children of Lithuanian Jewish immigrants.\n\nIn 2016, his son Bryan Glazer donated \u20ac3.28 million for the renovation and conversion of a historic building in Tampa, Florida into the Bryan Glazer Family Jewish Community Centre.\n\nAfter Manchester United\u2019s match with Fulham, manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer declined to alter the political mood or bust out diplomatic moves. Instead he jumped to the defence of his two players, explaining that his team is one of different backgrounds, different cultures and different countries.\n\nTeam changing rooms were hothouses for suppressed emotions, casual racism, places where honesty was mistaken for weakness\n\nPSV Eindhoven\u2019s Israeli forward Eran Zahavi responded too. He posted an edited picture of the pair on Instagram, replacing the Palestine flag they were carrying with one from Israel.\n\nPogba is French born to Guinean parents. While he plays for France, his two brothers Florentin and Mathias play with the Guinean national team. He is Muslim. Diallo was born in Abidjan in Ivory Coast and immigrated to Italy as a child. He is Muslim too, as is Choudhury, who has played for England and has Bangladeshi-Grenadian ancestry, while Fofana is French-born of Malian decent.\n\nWhat has been evident for some time in football, in Europe at least, is a power shift from the boardroom to the pitch and the bathing of traditional monochrome British football culture in a multicultural wash. With that comes attitude and some enlightenment.\n\nPlayers, with Mo Salah, Raheem Sterling and Marcus Rashford all assuming dignified social postures, have been empowered and have come to believe in themselves as much as functions of their beliefs and experiences as bland corporate faces in clubs like Manchester United or Liverpool.\n\nIn the past, cheesy photo opportunities of football stars visiting a children\u2019s hospital or handing an oversized cheque to a local charity would do it.\n\nBut team changing rooms were hothouses for suppressed emotions, casual racism, places where honesty was mistaken for weakness and any political views outside the traditional norm seen as perilous and threatening.\n\nLargely, footballers were emotionally constrained and conservative, politically inert. There were exceptions, like Bill Shankly and Robbie Fowler.\n\nHomophobic abuse\n\nIn 1997 Fowler had just scored his second goal in a European Cup Winners Cup against Norway\u2019s Brann Bergan when he lifted up his Liverpool shirt to reveal a T-shirt with the slogan \u201cSupport the 500 sacked dockers\u201d. For that he was fined 2,000 Swiss Francs by Uefa.\n\nIt was Fowler again whose actions in an incident inspired a tirade of homophobic abuse at Graeme Le Saux in 1999. Le Saux complained to the referee and linesman, who saw the incident but took no action. The Chelsea player was then booked for time-wasting. Not just the players but officials were also complicit and capable of contradiction.\n\nBut the goalposts have moved and continue to do so. For every note of irresponsible arrogance, every shot of a millionaire footballer spilling from a night club into a Lamborghini, there is a Rashford using his name, image and money to embarrass a government into extending free school meals to children.\n\nIf nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem\n\nThere is a Mesut Ozil taking aim in 2019 at Muslim countries for their silence over the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China, his club Arsenal distancing itself.\n\nIn 2019 a study \u2013 Can Exposure to Celebrities Reduce Prejudice? The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes \u2013 conducted by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University in the United States, found the number of hate crimes in the Merseyside area had fallen since Salah joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017.\n\nOver the previous two years there were 18.9 per cent fewer hate crimes than predicted, and a 53 per cent fall in anti-Muslim tweets among Liverpool fans.\n\nLast June, on the day Premier League matches resumed after lockdown, every player, referee and official took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nThat came almost three years after American footballer Colin Kaepernick filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing league owners of collusion to keep him out of the league for doing exactly that.\n\nThe Glazer family, through their ownership of the NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers, would have been party to Kaepernick\u2019s grievances.\n\nAt Manchester United, they could if they wished take action against Pogba and Diallo. But the Premier League is not the NFL and Europe is not the USA.\n\nThe sport has seismically shifted and whatever side people pick, Palestinian or Israeli, the majority of public sentiment probably rests with 63 dead children in Gaza.\n\nIf nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem. That kind of interrogation cuts both ways and different sides will be taken. Football\u2019s makeover is players being a truthful version of themselves, a pose that would never have been tolerated in the past.",

For every note of irresponsible arrogance, every shot of a millionaire footballer spilling from a night club into a Lamborghini, there is a Rashford using his name, image and money to embarrass a government into extending free school meals to children.</p>\n\n<blockquote>If nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem</blockquote>\n\n<p>There is a <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mesut+Ozil\">Mesut Ozil</a> taking aim in 2019 at Muslim countries for their silence over the persecution of Uighur Muslims in China, his club Arsenal distancing itself.</p>\n\n<p>In 2019 a study \u2013 Can Exposure to Celebrities Reduce Prejudice? The Effect of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mohamed+Salah\">Mohamed Salah</a> on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes \u2013 conducted by the Immigration Policy Lab at Stanford University in the United States, found the number of hate crimes in the Merseyside area had fallen since Salah joined Liverpool in the summer of 2017.</p>\n\n<p>Over the previous two years there were 18.9 per cent fewer hate crimes than predicted, and a 53 per cent fall in anti-Muslim tweets among Liverpool fans.</p>\n\n<p>Last June, on the day Premier League matches resumed after lockdown, every player, referee and official took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement.</p>\n\n<p>That came almost three years after American footballer <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Colin+Kaepernick\">Colin Kaepernick</a> filed a grievance against the NFL, accusing league owners of collusion to keep him out of the league for doing exactly that.</p>\n\n<p>The Glazer family, through their ownership of the NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers, would have been party to Kaepernick\u2019s grievances.</p>\n\n<p>At Manchester United, they could if they wished take action against Pogba and Diallo. But the Premier League is not the NFL and Europe is not the USA.</p>\n\n<p>The sport has seismically shifted and whatever side people pick, Palestinian or Israeli, the majority of public sentiment probably rests with 63 dead children in Gaza.</p>\n\n<p>If nothing more, the players have prompted people to ask serious questions about a difficult problem. That kind of interrogation cuts both ways and different sides will be taken. Football\u2019s makeover is players being a truthful version of themselves, a pose that would never have been tolerated in the past.</p>\n\n</article>",

I\u2019m not going to be worth that for the next two or three years.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The interview with Neville was recorded this month before Kane\u2019s desire for a transfer had been communicated to Spurs. Kane said of his future that \u201cit\u2019s going to be down to me and how I feel\u201d, but Levy can be expected to see things differently with the player having three years on his contract.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt\u2019s a moment in my career where I have to kind of reflect and see where I\u2019m at and have a good, honest conversation with the chairman,\u201d Kane said. \u201cI hope that we can have that conversation. I\u2019m sure that he\u2019ll want to set out the plan of where he sees it but ultimately it\u2019s going to be down to me and how I feel and what\u2019s going to be the best for me and my career at this moment in time.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cFor me it is \u2013 I don\u2019t want to have come to the end of my career and have any regrets. So, I want to be the best that I can be. I\u2019ve said before, I\u2019d never say that I\u2019d stay at Spurs for the rest of my career. I\u2019d never say that I would leave Spurs. I\u2019m at that stage where you could say, you know. People might look at it as, \u2018He\u2019s desperate for trophies, he needs trophies\u2019.\u201d - Guardian</p>\n\n</article>",

West Ham will reach Europe if they avoid defeat to Southampton on Sunday, while the Baggies announced after the game that head coach Sam Allardyce would step down at the end of the season.\n\nThe 6,000 fans spread across the Hawthorns were in festive mood, their spirits lifted by being allowed to return to the ground for the first time in over 14 months, even if it was just to wave at their team on the way down to the Championship.

        "description": "Pursuit of harmony has been cornerstone of Deschamps\u2019 reign as France manager",
        "articleBody": "The pursuit of harmony has been the cornerstone of Didier Deschamps\u2019 reign as France manager.\n\nThe 1998 World Cup-winning captain sought to become a World Cup-winning coach not by repeatedly picking the best 23 players, but by moulding a squad defined by togetherness and bereft of cliques and clashing egos. As such, the inclusion of Karim Benzema in his 26-man party for Euro 2020 after nearly six years out in the cold was more than surprising. Deschamps\u2019 unusually bold decision could destabilise all that he has worked so hard to achieve.\n\nDeschamps knows the value of an excellent atmosphere more than most. In recent decades, French society has regularly been divided along racial or religious lines. But the side he captained in 1998 \u2013 which was often referred to as \u201cblack, blanc, beur\u201d or \u201cblack, white, Arab\u201d \u2013 brought a fractious society together by representing all of France. \u201cIt was not about religion or the colour of your skin, we didn\u2019t care about that,\u201d Zinedine Zidane said later. \u201cWe were just together and enjoyed the moment.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, Raymond Domenech found out at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa just how quickly a France squad could be destabilised by conflicting egos. The various scenes \u2013 Patrice Evra confronting assistant coach Robert Duverne; the squad hiding on the team bus in support of Nicolas Anelka following his row with Domenech; the forlorn-looking coach himself reading a squad statement denouncing the French authorities \u2013 amounted to a national disgrace as the team crashed out of the tournament without a win.\n\nSince Deschamps\u2019 appointment in 2012, troublesome influences have been slowly phased out. His tactic of placing harmony above all else has unequivocally worked. France are world champions and were the width of a post away from winning Euro 2016. Benzema was absent from both tournaments after the infamous Mathieu Valbuena \u201csex-tape\u201d scandal engulfed the squad, further accentuating divisions among players.\n\nHis return amounts to a stunning admission: that Deschamps and France need Benzema. And, perhaps more flabbergasting still, that Deschamps is willing to risk his camp\u2019s togetherness despite its success so far. \u201cWe met, we spoke at length, I then thought very hard and came to this decision,\u201d said Deschamps. \u201cI needed this chat. He needed this chat. As national team boss, I have always looked beyond my personal case. My responsibility is important. It\u2019s bigger than me.\u201d\n\nAlthough one L\u2019\u00c9quipe journalist reported that some players in the camp were \u201ccrazy excited\u201d by Benzema\u2019s call-up, he will do well to avoid a collision course with incumbent centre-forward Olivier Giroud. When compared with Giroud last year, Benzema remarked: \u201cYou don\u2019t confuse Formula 1 with karting, and I am being nice.\u201d\n\nScandal\n\nMeanwhile, the scandal of the sex tape still hangs over Benzema. If anything, his legal situation has worsened over time. He will stand trial in October for allegedly acting as an intermediary between a group of blackmailers and Valbuena, and for allegedly pressuring his former teammate to pay off the blackmailers. After being dropped from the France squad after the scandal, Benzema accused Deschamps of \u201cyielding under the pressure of a racist part of France\u201d by not picking him.\n\nJust because he has returned to the squad does not necessarily mean he will start. The fact he will wear the No 19 shirt could be a sign that Giroud will remain first choice. Deschamps has remained coy on his team selection. \u201cThey have played together before,\u201d he mused. \u201cThey don\u2019t actually get in each other\u2019s way. Giroud has been in a difficult situation in his club since February. That is a fact.\u201d\n\nAlthough Giroud has been marginalised since Thomas Tuchel\u2019s arrival at Chelsea, a goal every 100 minutes in the Premier League and Champions League this season is stronger than Benzema\u2019s ratio of a goal every 130 minutes in La Liga and Europe. Giroud\u2019s international record is better too.\n\nHowever, Benzema\u2019s quality will be hard to ignore after perhaps the best season of his career. Leaving him out of the starting XI would be bizarre after the furore and risks taken in bringing him back. Yet Giroud embodies Deschamps\u2019 philosophy. A functional, malleable player who puts his team and his colleagues first, his relentless dummy-running and counter-pressing made time and space for Antoine Griezmann and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 as France won the World Cup.\n\nBenzema admitted as much himself, saying: \u201cHis style of play suits the French national team well. It works because he is there, that is the only reason. He is good because there are players like Mbapp\u00e9 or Griezmann who are fast and who play in the channels and pivot around the centre-forward. Him, up top, he weighs on defences, which allows the two others to move a lot and show a lot. He blocks and it works. It won\u2019t be spectacular, he won\u2019t do something amazing, but he has his thing.\u201d\n\nAlthough Benzema has become Real Madrid\u2019s only reliable source of goals in recent seasons and something of a talisman for the club, the role he describes is similar to the one he perfected in support of Cristiano Ronaldo as Madrid won a hat-trick of Champions League titles. He could do the same for France.\n\nAs Deschamps suggested, he could deploy both together in the asymmetric 4-2-3-1 he used in Russia. Benzema could even be used out wide as he was during the 2014 World Cup to such devastating effect in partnership with Giroud in the 5-2 win over Switzerland.\n\nAt 33, however, that seems unlikely. While a front three of Griezmann, Mbapp\u00e9 and Benzema is a thrilling proposition \u2013 a possible 4-3-3 would also free up Paul Pogba in midfield \u2013 Benzema may have to earn his place. With just two warmup friendlies his inclusion may only be cemented, assuming his club form persists, deeper into the tournament.\n\nAlthough Deschamps admitted \u201cthe list a year ago would not have been the one I have today\u201d his squad remains perhaps the strongest and deepest at the tournament. While nine world champions missed out, only Samuel Umtiti and Blaise Matuidi are absent from Deschamps\u2019 first choice XI from 2018.\n\nEven though his performances have been shaky in recent months, Presnel Kimpembe will start as Rapha\u00ebl Varane\u2019s partner in defence, with Sevilla defender Jules Kound\u00e9 and Kurt Zouma in reserve. Manchester City\u2019s Aymeric Laporte was again overlooked but will almost certainly play in the tournament for Spain.\n\nAnthony Martial is also absent, as \u201chis condition does not allow it\u201d Deschamps explained, while Houssem Aouar and Eduardo Camavinga\u2019s recent poor club form meant both were omitted too. Adrien Rabiot, who dramatically refused to be on the reserve list in 2018, made the full squad this time and could be used on the left of Deschamps\u2019 lopsided 4-2-3-1, with Matuidi\u2019s international career now over after he joined MLS outfit Inter Miami. Moussa Sissoko, a Deschamps favourite and key figure in achieving squad unity, again made the squad despite his lack of recent game time for Tottenham.\n\nBenzema\u2019s return could be an inspired move from Deschamps. With most of the group embroiled in the 2010 incident and the blackmail scandal now fading from memory, old divisions may have simply melted away. Mbapp\u00e9 immediately tweeted his support for Benzema and it was reported that Giroud did not object.",

The various scenes \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Patrice+Evra\">Patrice Evra</a> confronting assistant coach <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Robert+Duverne\">Robert Duverne</a>; the squad hiding on the team bus in support of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Nicolas+Anelka\">Nicolas Anelka</a> following his row with Domenech; the forlorn-looking coach himself reading a squad statement denouncing the French authorities \u2013 amounted to a national disgrace as the team crashed out of the tournament without a win.</p>\n\n<p>Since Deschamps\u2019 appointment in 2012, troublesome influences have been slowly phased out. His tactic of placing harmony above all else has unequivocally worked. France are world champions and were the width of a post away from winning Euro 2016. Benzema was absent from both tournaments after the infamous <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Mathieu+Valbuena\">Mathieu Valbuena</a> \u201csex-tape\u201d scandal engulfed the squad, further accentuating divisions among players.</p>\n\n<p>His return amounts to a stunning admission: that Deschamps and France need Benzema. And, perhaps more flabbergasting still, that Deschamps is willing to risk his camp\u2019s togetherness despite its success so far. \u201cWe met, we spoke at length, I then thought very hard and came to this decision,\u201d said Deschamps. \u201cI needed this chat. He needed this chat. As national team boss, I have always looked beyond my personal case. My responsibility is important. It\u2019s bigger than me.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Although one L\u2019\u00c9quipe journalist reported that some players in the camp were \u201ccrazy excited\u201d by Benzema\u2019s call-up, he will do well to avoid a collision course with incumbent centre-forward <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Olivier+Giroud\">Olivier Giroud</a>. When compared with Giroud last year, Benzema remarked: \u201cYou don\u2019t confuse Formula 1 with karting, and I am being nice.\u201d</p>\n\n<h2>Scandal</h2>\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the scandal of the sex tape still hangs over Benzema. If anything, his legal situation has worsened over time. He will stand trial in October for allegedly acting as an intermediary between a group of blackmailers and Valbuena, and for allegedly pressuring his former teammate to pay off the blackmailers. After being dropped from the France squad after the scandal, Benzema accused Deschamps of \u201cyielding under the pressure of a racist part of France\u201d by not picking him.</p>\n\n<p>Just because he has returned to the squad does not necessarily mean he will start. The fact he will wear the No 19 shirt could be a sign that Giroud will remain first choice. Deschamps has remained coy on his team selection. \u201cThey have played together before,\u201d he mused. \u201cThey don\u2019t actually get in each other\u2019s way. Giroud has been in a difficult situation in his club since February. That is a fact.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Although Giroud has been marginalised since Thomas Tuchel\u2019s arrival at <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Chelsea\">Chelsea</a>, a goal every 100 minutes in the Premier League and Champions League this season is stronger than Benzema\u2019s ratio of a goal every 130 minutes in La Liga and Europe. Giroud\u2019s international record is better too.</p>\n\n<p>However, Benzema\u2019s quality will be hard to ignore after perhaps the best season of his career. Leaving him out of the starting XI would be bizarre after the furore and risks taken in bringing him back. Yet Giroud embodies Deschamps\u2019 philosophy. A functional, malleable player who puts his team and his colleagues first, his relentless dummy-running and counter-pressing made time and space for <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Antoine+Griezmann\">Antoine Griezmann</a> and Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 as France won the World Cup.</p>\n\n<p>Benzema admitted as much himself, saying: \u201cHis style of play suits the French national team well. It works because he is there, that is the only reason. He is good because there are players like Mbapp\u00e9 or Griezmann who are fast and who play in the channels and pivot around the centre-forward. Him, up top, he weighs on defences, which allows the two others to move a lot and show a lot. He blocks and it works. It won\u2019t be spectacular, he won\u2019t do something amazing, but he has his thing.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Although Benzema has become Real Madrid\u2019s only reliable source of goals in recent seasons and something of a talisman for the club, the role he describes is similar to the one he perfected in support of <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Cristiano+Ronaldo\">Cristiano Ronaldo</a> as Madrid won a hat-trick of Champions League titles. He could do the same for France.</p>\n\n<p>As Deschamps suggested, he could deploy both together in the asymmetric 4-2-3-1 he used in Russia. Benzema could even be used out wide as he was during the 2014 World Cup to such devastating effect in partnership with Giroud in the 5-2 win over Switzerland.</p>\n\n<p>At 33, however, that seems unlikely. While a front three of Griezmann, Mbapp\u00e9 and Benzema is a thrilling proposition \u2013 a possible 4-3-3 would also free up <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Paul+Pogba\">Paul Pogba</a> in midfield \u2013 Benzema may have to earn his place. With just two warmup friendlies his inclusion may only be cemented, assuming his club form persists, deeper into the tournament.</p>\n\n<p>Although Deschamps admitted \u201cthe list a year ago would not have been the one I have today\u201d his squad remains perhaps the strongest and deepest at the tournament. While nine world champions missed out, only <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Samuel+Umtiti\">Samuel Umtiti</a> and <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Blaise+Matuidi\">Blaise Matuidi</a> are absent from Deschamps\u2019 first choice XI from 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Even though his performances have been shaky in recent months, Presnel Kimpembe will start as Rapha\u00ebl Varane\u2019s partner in defence, with <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_organisation=Sevilla\">Sevilla</a> defender Jules Kound\u00e9 and <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Kurt+Zouma\">Kurt Zouma</a> in reserve. Manchester City\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Aymeric+Laporte\">Aymeric Laporte</a> was again overlooked but will almost certainly play in the tournament for Spain.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Anthony+Martial\">Anthony Martial</a> is also absent, as \u201chis condition does not allow it\u201d Deschamps explained, while <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Houssem+Aouar\">Houssem Aouar</a> and Eduardo Camavinga\u2019s recent poor club form meant both were omitted too. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Adrien+Rabiot\">Adrien Rabiot</a>, who dramatically refused to be on the reserve list in 2018, made the full squad this time and could be used on the left of Deschamps\u2019 lopsided 4-2-3-1, with Matuidi\u2019s international career now over after he joined MLS outfit Inter Miami. <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Moussa+Sissoko\">Moussa Sissoko</a>, a Deschamps favourite and key figure in achieving squad unity, again made the squad despite his lack of recent game time for Tottenham.</p>\n\n<p>Benzema\u2019s return could be an inspired move from Deschamps. With most of the group embroiled in the 2010 incident and the blackmail scandal now fading from memory, old divisions may have simply melted away. Mbapp\u00e9 immediately tweeted his support for Benzema and it was reported that Giroud did not object.</p>\n\n</article>",

        "articleBody": "Burnley 0 Liverpool 3\n\nJ\u00fcrgen Klopp is accustomed to his seasons going down to the wire but the identity of the men who have left Liverpool on the cusp of Champions League qualification may have surprised even him. First Alisson at West Bromwich Albion, now Nat Phillips at Burnley; the unlikeliest influences are behind the late rescue act.\n\nPhillips headed home his first Liverpool goal and was at the forefront of a valuable clean sheet as Klopp\u2019s side secured another precious victory in their bid for a top four finish. The defeat of Sean Dyche\u2019s team, commenced by Roberto Firmino and finished by substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, elevated Liverpool above Leicester in the race for Champions League football and improved their goal difference over Brendan Rodgers\u2019 team to plus four. One more win, over Roy Hodgson\u2019s Crystal Palace in the former Liverpool manager\u2019s last top flight game, and redemption will be found on the final day at Anfield.\n\nBurnley had altered the course of Liverpool\u2019s season in January with the away win that ended the then champions\u2019 68-game unbeaten run at Anfield and sparked an unprecedented six-match losing streak on home soil.\n\nTheir prospects of also derailing Liverpool\u2019s Champions League prospects did not look so bright at Turf Moor, where Sean Dyche\u2019s team last won a Premier League game in January and had taken merely five points from the last 27 available. They also had a goalkeeper, Will Norris, making his Premier League debut for the club in place of the injured Nick Pope. The 27-year-old\u2019s previous top flight experience amounted to an 89th minute substitute appearance for Wolves in 2018-19.\n\nWith Chris Wood up against a vulnerable Liverpool central defence, however, and Dwight McNeil, Matthew Lowton and Johann Gudmundsson aiming for the New Zealand striker at almost every opportunity, Burnley had the armoury \u2013 and a vociferous backing \u2013 to serve up another uncomfortable evening for Klopp\u2019s side. But the visitors, while uncertain in the heart of defence, were vibrant, dangerous and assured in every other department and created enough clear-cut chances to have established a commanding lead by the break.\n\nBurnley started well but were sliced open from Liverpool\u2019s first attack of note when a fine ball from Andy Robertson released Mohamed Salah behind the home defence. An excellent covering tackle by Ben Mee prevented the Egypt international from taking full advantage. Mee\u2019s central defensive partner, James Tarkowski, produced a similar challenge to deny Sadio Man\u00e9 when Salah found the striker unmarked inside the area.\n\nMan\u00e9 had missed the game\u2019s first genuine opening when Trent Alexander-Arnold\u2019s cross deflected into his path in front of Norris\u2019 goal. The Senegal forward steered his shot wide at full stretch. Firmino turned a decent chance wide from Man\u00e9\u2019s back-heel, Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara dragged a shot wide of the far post following a neat exchange inside the area with Salah and, seconds later, with Robertson taking a leaf out of Burnley\u2019s book to launch a long ball over the top, Liverpool\u2019s leading goalscorer blazed over with only Norris to beat. When Phillips sent a half volley high over from Rhys Williams\u2019 knock-down, the sense that Liverpool might be made to pay once again for their profligacy intensified. But one flowing move later, they were ahead.\n\nRobertson combined with Man\u00e9 down the left and, with Gudmundsson failing to track the full-back\u2019s run, he pulled an inviting cross back from the by-line for the unmarked Firmino to side-foot home from 12 yards. Norris should have done better with a shot that was close to his left leg and Turf Moor, for once, fell silent bar the sound of a celebrating Klopp.\n\nBurnley had engineered, and missed, several opportuntites of their own prior to Firmino\u2019s breakthrough. Lowton was unfortunate with a goal-bound drive that struck Williams\u2019 head and deflected over, while Alisson saved bravely at the feet of Wood following a goalmouth scramble and from McNeil\u2019s powerful drive. Liverpool\u2019s goalscoring goalkeeper should have been given no chance when Wood latched on to Lowton\u2019s ball into the area only to slice wide on the half volley from close range.\n\nLiverpool were far more polished in attack, patient too, and doubled their lead early in the second half through Phillips\u2019 first goal for the club. The centre-half had grown into his duel with Wood and also shone at the opposite end of the pitch when Man\u00e9 beat Lowton to the by-line and lofted an inch-perfect cross into the area. Phillips, somehow escaping the attentions of the Burnley defence, rose to plant an unstoppable header beyond the exposed Norris.\n\nPhillips excelled again to head off the line from Mee when the Burnley captain met McNeil\u2019s corner with a towering back post header. Burnley continued to battle but in the final minute Oxlade-Chamberlain, receiving Robertson\u2019s pass into the area, bamboozled Charlie Taylor with fine footwork before driving inside Norris\u2019 near post. \u2013 Guardian",

They have won four consecutive Premier League games for the first time since October 2018 and will not mind that this defeat of Crystal Palace, who deserved to honour the retiring Roy Hodgson with a win, came via their only three shots on target.\n\nMikel Arteta\u2019s team had hardly threatened in the second half when, in added time, Gabriel Martinelli ghosted onto a cross from his fellow substitute Martin \u00d8degaard and converted scruffily. Nicolas P\u00e9p\u00e9, whose superb opener had been cancelled out by Christian Benteke, still had time to score an equally outstanding third and set up a final day that now feels alive with possibility.\n\nAt kick-off the sun had shone above Selhurst Park, a rarity for this particular month, and the stars had aligned too. Hodgson\u2019s farewell would take place to a crowd of around 6,500; an emotional return met with a poignant departure, and the guard of honour with which both sides greeted the retiring manager onto the pitch must have meant so much more when accompanied by a resounding chorus of \u201che\u2019s one of our own\u201d.\n\nDuring Hodgson\u2019s tenure, Palace have understood how to give Arsenal a game. They had won one and drawn five of the teams\u2019 previous six encounters: getting in those games and staying them, that record perhaps summing up the consistency and redoubtable quality Hodgson has instilled. This time Palace were shorn of Eberechi Eze, whose exceptional creativity will be missed for several months due to an achilles injury, but the pattern of previous years was largely unaltered until P\u00e9p\u00e9 scored with Arsenal\u2019s first genuine chance.\n\nIt was marvellously worked, Kieran Tierney slipping a pass to Bukayo Saka and then making a run inside the winger, who located him with a chopped backheel. Tierney could size up a cross from near the byline and P\u00e9p\u00e9, arriving to meet the delivery at waist-height near the penalty spot, executed an expertly-controlled volley with his right foot.\n\nFor a snapshot of Arteta\u2019s Arsenal at their best it will take some beating. They had threatened down the flanks during the previous 35 minutes but Palace, as so often, held firm in central areas. The hosts might have felt regret that they were not ahead: James Tomkins had worked Bernd Leno with a firm header midway through the half and shortly afterwards Benteke, rising at the far post to meet Andros Townsend\u2019s deep free-kick, thudded off target when he could quite feasibly have scored.\n\nBefore P\u00e9p\u00e9\u2019s goal there was still time for Leno to make an exceptional save, sprawling leftwards to tip Jeffrey Schlupp\u2019s deflected volley wide. As with most of the games played to returning crowds this week there was a distinct edge to many of the challenges, not to mention the reactions to them. There was rancour when Benteke clashed off the ball with Mohamed Elneny, both players receiving bookings even though the former had appeared to glance his opponent\u2019s face with an elbow.\n\nIt was inevitable, then, that Benteke should inflict an even more telling blow just after the hour. He had missed another header within seconds of the restart so this was third time lucky and, for Arsenal\u2019s defence, a costly moment of inattention. Palace had struggled to get going since the interval but, when Townsend sized up another left-sided free-kick, rightly sensed another opportunity. The delivery was, not for the first time, perfect and an unmarked Benteke gave Leno no chance this time. His firm, stooping finish was validated by VAR, which ruled he had neither strayed offside nor committed a foul on Elneny in escaping the Arsenal back line.\n\nNow Palace\u2019s tails were back up and Leno had to smother at close quarters when Benteke, oozing confidence and seeking a fifth goal in four games, sought to bustle through at a tight angle. With 15 minutes left Calum Chambers thwarted Wilfried Zaha and the frustration for Arsenal was that, with some kind of positive resolution to their season still available, they were hardly battering the door. The Palace substitute Jordan Ayew came close but then, against all logic, Martinelli provided a sucker punch.

        "description": "Three-time All-Ireland winning Dublin footballer became French club\u2019s first foreign player in 1980",
        "articleBody": "La Rochelle may have a fair sprinkling of top-level foreign players in their ranks nowadays but back in 1977 they held a vote to decide whether they would allow All Blacks legend Graham Mourie to join the club. Almost unanimously, they voted against.\n\nBut three years later, the three-time Dublin All-Ireland winner, David Hickey, became their first foreign player.\n\nCritically, Jacques Larroze, the owner of a local fishing company and a former fullback, had become the club\u2019s new president.\n\n\u201cHe was more liberal and more interested in changing the image of La Rochelle,\u201d explains Richard Escot, a long-standing rugby writer with L\u2019\u00c9quipe who hails from La Rochelle.\n\nLarroze enlisted the French TV commentator Pierre Salviac to help find their first foreigner. He contacted Ollie Campbell, who in turn contacted a team-mate on Belvedere\u2019s 1972 Leinster Schools Senior Cup winning team, Michael Hickey, who in turn mentioned it to his older brother David, then a medical student.\n\nHickey had subscribed to the monthly French rugby journal Miroir du Rugby.\n\n\u201cI loved French rugby in the 60s and 70s and it\u2019s nice to see Fabien Galthie bringing French rugby back in that direction because it had been appalling to watch for the last 10 or 15 years.\u201d\n\nHickey had played with Clontarf and UCD previously, and Dublin\u2019s run of six successive All-Ireland finals under Kevin Heffernan had come to an end with defeat by Offaly in the Leinster Championship. La Rochelle also found him work in a local hospital for the first year and in Bordeaux for his second season.\n\n\u201cI had the advantage of being very fit moving into their pre-season and the rest is history. Everyone had very long memories and they never forgot an injustice or an injury, so it was pretty violent, just like playing Gaelic football, so I felt very at home,\u201d he says laughing.\n\n\u201cYou could have a 30-point win at home one weekend and the next weekend you could lose by the same amount. The referees gave the away teams nothing.\u201d\n\nAs a fullback he also had full licence to counterattack.\n\nAlthough he will support La Rochelle in the Heineken Champions Cup final at Twickenham on Saturday (kick-off 4.45pm and live on Virgin Media, Channel 4 and BT Sport) he has a fondness for Toulouse dating back to a 9-9 draw against Jean-Pierre Rives et al in the Yves du Manoir tournament in 1981.\n\n10 years ago today: Johnny Sexton inspires Leinster\u2019s Northampton comeback\nSpringboks return for 2021 Rugby Championship\nBorthwick eyes Challenge Cup glory despite Leicester\u2019s underdog status\n\n\u201cToulouse were always a superior club in that they never resorted to violence, almost uniquely. Our own boys were rough enough but if you played down in Toulon, Carcassone or Aurillac, it could be frightening.\n\n\u201cBut then the meal after the match was a huge event and the players were experts in the different wines in the different regions, and they\u2019d talk for hours about the foie gras.\n\n\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been a medical graduate I would have stayed in France and run a bar or a restaurant or a gym, something like that, and lived happily ever after. Maybe it\u2019s not too late.\u201d\n\nOn returning to Ireland he was placed in Waterford, and played for a year with Waterpark where his father Patrick had played.\n\nTo mark Hickey\u2019s farewell, La Rochelle hosted a Clontarf side featuring three Irish international guests, the aforementioned Campbell, Donal Spring and Terry Kennedy, in May 1982.\n\nClontarf won and the next day they took part in an eight-a-side tournament on the island of \u00cele de R\u00e9.\n\n\u201cAs you can imagine we weren\u2019t exactly in great shape for it,\u201d recalls Spring. \u201cHaving been hammered in the pool stages by the La Rochelle \u2018B\u2019 the playoffs were late enough in the afternoon to have recovered and we managed to beat the \u2018A\u2019 team in the semi-final and the \u2018B\u2019 team in the final with Terry Kennedy getting man of the match.\n\n\u201cThe players all got a box of oysters as their prize which we duly gave away to people in the crowd and then got the boat back to La Rochelle and had another good evening,\u201d says Spring, who played for the next two seasons with Bagn\u00e9res after qualifying as a solicitor.\n\nHe describes Hickey as a great rugby player.\n\n\u201cHe was just a very good footballer, very strong and had all the skills. He was very highly spoken of in La Rochelle and very popular. In France, as a foreign player, you\u2019re either fully accepted or you\u2019re rejected, there\u2019s no half-way house.\u201d\n\nEscot concurs. \u201cWhen you say the name of David Hickey in La Rochelle everybody has a smile and a good story about him.\u201d\n\nEx team-mates even formed a Celtic Club in Ch\u00e2telaillon, a seaport town just south of La Rochelle.\n\n\u201cIt celebrates celtic culture in the local area, dance, music, rugby and Guinness, and also Gaelic football,\u201d says Escot.\n\nFour years ago, several of them visited Dublin for the All-Ireland final, when Dublin drew with Mayo, Hickey acting as ticket provider and host.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s leading transplant surgeons, Hickey\u2019s work has also taken him to Bahrain, Sudan, Egypt and latterly Dubai, but mostly to Cuba.\n\n\u201cI have been going there for about 25 years. My late wife was Cuban. I always admired them in the Olympics, their dignity and their sense of country. [Te\u00f3filo] Stevenson and these guys never took the big bucks in the United States,\u201d Hickey says in reference to the famed triple Olympic gold medallist.\n\n\u201cWe used to go for three months every year when my wife, Yamile, was alive. She was a neuro-surgeon and she worked there for three months every year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I went there I wasn\u2019t disappointed on any level. The humanity of the place is enormous. They have alleviated poverty essentially. Nobody is rich but there\u2019s nobody without a home, an education or health care.\n\n\u201cMy mother-in-law is staying with me at the moment and what she misses most about Cuba is her free morning Tai Chi lessons in the local park. It\u2019s actually a more developed society than America\u2019s or our own one by default. It\u2019s the fourth world rather than the third world, potentially the future for a lot of people I think.\u201d\n\nHickey, who now works part-time in the Mater Hospital, has been helping his son David study for the Leaving Cert after what has been a tough year and a half. In January last year he and David flew back from Cuba and the night they returned home received a phone call from Havana to inform them that Yamile had died in a drowning accident, meaning a cruelly swift return the next day for her funeral.\n\nSport has been a welcome release for him during the various lockdowns and Hickey accepts he was probably the only Dubliner to support La Rochelle in the semi-final against Leinster. To his regret, he has only found time for one return visit to his old French club.\n\n\u201cI would love to have been in La Rochelle for that semi-final. I do intend this summer, if things open up, to drive down to La Rochelle with my young fella and meet up with the La Rochelle boys and the celtic club in Ch\u00e2telaillon!\u201d",

Our own boys were rough enough but if you played down in Toulon, Carcassone or Aurillac, it could be frightening.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cBut then the meal after the match was a huge event and the players were experts in the different wines in the different regions, and they\u2019d talk for hours about the foie gras.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIf I hadn\u2019t been a medical graduate I would have stayed in France and run a bar or a restaurant or a gym, something like that, and lived happily ever after. Maybe it\u2019s not too late.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>On returning to Ireland he was placed in Waterford, and played for a year with Waterpark where his father Patrick had played.</p>\n\n<p>To mark Hickey\u2019s farewell, La Rochelle hosted a Clontarf side featuring three Irish international guests, the aforementioned Campbell, <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Donal+Spring\">Donal Spring</a> and <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Terry+Kennedy\">Terry Kennedy</a>, in May 1982.</p>\n\n<p>Clontarf won and the next day they took part in an eight-a-side tournament on the island of \u00cele de R\u00e9.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cAs you can imagine we weren\u2019t exactly in great shape for it,\u201d recalls Spring. \u201cHaving been hammered in the pool stages by the La Rochelle \u2018B\u2019 the playoffs were late enough in the afternoon to have recovered and we managed to beat the \u2018A\u2019 team in the semi-final and the \u2018B\u2019 team in the final with Terry Kennedy getting man of the match.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cThe players all got a box of oysters as their prize which we duly gave away to people in the crowd and then got the boat back to La Rochelle and had another good evening,\u201d says Spring, who played for the next two seasons with Bagn\u00e9res after qualifying as a solicitor.</p>\n\n<p>He describes Hickey as a great rugby player.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cHe was just a very good footballer, very strong and had all the skills. He was very highly spoken of in La Rochelle and very popular. In France, as a foreign player, you\u2019re either fully accepted or you\u2019re rejected, there\u2019s no half-way house.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Escot concurs. \u201cWhen you say the name of David Hickey in La Rochelle everybody has a smile and a good story about him.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Ex team-mates even formed a Celtic Club in Ch\u00e2telaillon, a seaport town just south of La Rochelle.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cIt celebrates celtic culture in the local area, dance, music, rugby and Guinness, and also Gaelic football,\u201d says Escot.</p>\n\n<p>Four years ago, several of them visited Dublin for the All-Ireland final, when Dublin drew with Mayo, Hickey acting as ticket provider and host.</p>\n\n<p>As one of the world\u2019s leading transplant surgeons, Hickey\u2019s work has also taken him to Bahrain, Sudan, Egypt and latterly Dubai, but mostly to Cuba.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI have been going there for about 25 years. My late wife was Cuban. I always admired them in the Olympics, their dignity and their sense of country. [Te\u00f3filo] Stevenson and these guys never took the big bucks in the United States,\u201d Hickey says in reference to the famed triple Olympic gold medallist.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWe used to go for three months every year when my wife, Yamile, was alive. She was a neuro-surgeon and she worked there for three months every year.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>\u201cWhen I went there I wasn\u2019t disappointed on any level. The humanity of the place is enormous. They have alleviated poverty essentially. Nobody is rich but there\u2019s nobody without a home, an education or health care.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMy mother-in-law is staying with me at the moment and what she misses most about Cuba is her free morning Tai Chi lessons in the local park. It\u2019s actually a more developed society than America\u2019s or our own one by default. It\u2019s the fourth world rather than the third world, potentially the future for a lot of people I think.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Hickey, who now works part-time in the Mater Hospital, has been helping his son David study for the Leaving Cert after what has been a tough year and a half. In January last year he and David flew back from Cuba and the night they returned home received a phone call from Havana to inform them that Yamile had died in a drowning accident, meaning a cruelly swift return the next day for her funeral.</p>\n\n<p>Sport has been a welcome release for him during the various lockdowns and Hickey accepts he was probably the only Dubliner to support La Rochelle in the semi-final against Leinster. To his regret, he has only found time for one return visit to his old French club.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cI would love to have been in La Rochelle for that semi-final. I do intend this summer, if things open up, to drive down to La Rochelle with my young fella and meet up with the La Rochelle boys and the celtic club in Ch\u00e2telaillon!\u201d</p>\n\n</article>",

        "articleBody": "The announced departure of Eir Sports from the sports broadcasting sector didn\u2019t come as a major surprise. Once the company had announced in March that it wouldn\u2019t be bidding for any more sports rights, the show was effectively over, but it does break a link with the origins of the GAA\u2019s policy on the use of paywalls for its broadcasts.\n\nIt was just 15 years ago that Eir\u2019s predecessors Setanta first broadcast national league matches. A subscription channel, it was initially included on the NTL platform, which meant that a large number of subscribers in urban areas, including Dublin, didn\u2019t have to pay for it \u2013 unlike those who weren\u2019t NTL customers\n\nLooking back, it\u2019s interesting the extent to which the involvement of Setanta was viewed as less contentious than the acquisition of championship rights by Sky Sports eight years later.\n\nThe narrative was one of a young Irish company \u2013 which had greatly increased the GAA\u2019s take on its overseas rights \u2013 developing a business as opposed to Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Sky conglomerate.\n\nLiam Mulvihill, in his 2006 annual report, welcomed Setanta.\n\n\u201cAt the time of writing we are concluding negotiations for a new three-year contract with RT\u00c9 and TG4, which will give them the vast bulk of our games, but Setanta Sport will be coming on board as well and I am sure they will bring a vitality and a new approach to the coverage of our games.\n\n\u201cTheir arrival as a dedicated sports channel is to be welcomed and may well impact significantly on the future of sports television broadcasting for all sports in this country.\u201d\n\nAt first, only football matches were covered.

Cork was the only Division One county with the facilities.\n\n\u201cMy understanding is that no team would play Cork under lights, as Cork have played there too often,\u201d said Setanta\u2019s Maurice Reidy at the time. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons we don\u2019t have hurling. All our matches are from Division One A of the football league because that\u2019s where the floodlit grounds are, but, come spring 2007, there\u2019ll be a greater variety of venues available.\u201d\n\nThe first fixture broadcast by Setanta was Kerry-Mayo on February 1st, 2006.

        "articleBody": "The director of the Irish Milers Club meeting in Belfast later this month has urged Athletics Ireland to reconsider his request to support a European permit, which would afford competing athletes the chance to gain valuable ranking points towards Tokyo Olympic qualification.\n\nSet for the Mary Peters Track in Belfast on Saturday week, May 29th, a European permit was originally awarded last December, after an application by meeting director Eamonn Christie, the long-serving athletics coach in Belfast who previously worked with the likes of Ciara Mageean.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, it emerged that application had to be supported by Athletics Ireland, and not just signed off on their behalf by Christie, along with Michael McGovern of the Irish Milers Club. Christie openly admits the error, which resulted in European Athletics revoking the permit having been contacted by Athletics Ireland, although the re-granting of that permit is still possible with Athletics Ireland support.\n\n\u201cI will certainly hold my hands up on that, call it my inexperience, or my naivety, but I didn\u2019t realise I had to go through the national federation,\u201d Christie told The Irish Times. \u201cI\u2019ve made them [Athletics Ireland] well aware of that. And I did eat humble pie, I did apologise, writing them a couple of emails, begging them not to stop the permit.\u201d\n\nIn response to the matter, Athletics Ireland did issue a short statement on Thursday afternoon: \u201cAthletics Ireland only became aware of the Belfast Irish Milers Meet application for a European Athletics permit recently. European Athletics withdrew their permit for this Meet due to administrative concerns.\u201d\n\nSeveral Irish Tokyo contenders are still set to compete, including Phil Healy in the 200m, Mark English in the 800m, Andrew Coscoran and Paul Robinson in the 1,500m, along with emerging distance running talents such as Cian McPhillips, Luke McCann and John Fitzsimons. A special invite has also been extended to the Irish women\u2019s 4x200m squad of Aoife Lynch, Kate Doherty, Sarah Quinn and Sophie Becker, who finished second in the event at the recent World Athletics Relays.\n\nThe meeting still has a UK level two permit, which means any Tokyo qualifying time, underage record, etc will stand: \u201cIt\u2019s the extra ranking points that most athletes are after at this stage,\u201d said Christie. \u201cAlmost all the runners I\u2019ve contacted are still coming, which is reassuring, because we have been preparing for a long time now to put on an excellent track meet, with quality sponsors and we also have prize money.\n\n\u201cAthletics Ireland say they were only made aware of this meeting over the last two weeks, when I\u2019ve been trying to promote this meeting, more than I normally would, trying to get athletes involved, from early March. But there\u2019s no budging them. Even though I do have the permit from Northern Ireland Athletics, which gives me insurance, and I have all the Covid-19 restrictions in place, all the first aid, all that.\n\n\u201cThe big thing for me is that they\u2019re denying their own athletes the chance to get ranking points for Tokyo. That\u2019s what this meeting is about, helping our home-grown athletes to get points towards Tokyo qualification. European Athletics are saying to me, even at this stage, that once they sign the form, there\u2019s no problem. There is no deadline, they are saying. But if Athletics Ireland won\u2019t sign the permit, it will be 2022 before they can re-engage on the matter.\u201d",

Canada\u2019s Corey Conners is the leader - he is two strokes clear at the top of the leaderboard following an impressive effort of 67 on a tough day of scoring in south Carolina. Brooks Koepka and Viktor Hovland are among those lurking on three under par, however it was a familiar story for Rory McIlroy who made another slow start in a Major championship. The 32-year-old made three birdies and six bogeys in a rollercoaster round, signing for a disappointing 75 and leaving himself with plenty to do in today\u2019s second round. Shane Lowry meanwhile was left to rue some bad luck on the 17th - his ball plugging in the sand - as he opened with a one over par effort of 73. Today Harrington tees off at 12.49pm as he looks to continue his early momentum, with Lowry off at 1.44pm and McIlroy among the later starters at 6.58pm (all Irish time). You can follow all of the second round action via our liveblog, which will be up and running from around midday.\n\nEarlier this week Manchester United\u2019s Paul Pogba and Amad Diallo made headlines after they carried a Palestinian flag around the Old Trafford pitch following their side\u2019s final home game of the season against Fulham.

        "articleBody": "What do Elena Delle Donne, Kevin Durant, Kelley O\u2019Hara, Sam Mewis and others have in common? Well, as of last week, they have all invested money into Just Women\u2019s Sports, an online platform solely dedicated to the promotion and analysis of women\u2019s sports. In fact, they believe in women\u2019s sports platforms so much, CEO Haley Rosen and her crew received $3.5 million to grow their brand along with the women\u2019s game.\n\n\u201cOur ambition is to really be the one-stop shop for all things women\u2019s sports. That means expanding our digital channels, growing out our audio network. We would love to get into premium content. For us, we want to make the games accessible, we want the games. We have a vision for this company that you go to justwomenssports.com, put in your name, put in your password, and unlock this whole world of women\u2019s sports,\u201d explains Rosen.\n\nRosen is a former professional soccer player with Washington Spirit and a graduate of Stanford University, where she was named an All-Pac-12 midfielder while playing for Stanford. Now, she devotes her time to Just Women\u2019s Sports.\n\n\u201cI really believe a lot of mainstream sports media is built around men\u2019s sports. If you look at a lot of the major networks in the US, they focus on the NFL, NBA, MLB \u2013 these are all men\u2019s sports leagues. They have audiences that are there for men\u2019s sports brands that want to sponsor men\u2019s sports. For us, I think that there\u2019s a real opportunity to go do that and build that for women\u2019s sports and set up a structure that is set up for women\u2019s sports to just dominate and bring in brands that want audiences there for women\u2019s sports.\n\n\u201cSomething that I\u2019ve really learned on this journey is I thought initially, hey, here\u2019s your sports fans, and you want to convert a certain percentage over to women\u2019s sports. I do think that\u2019s part of it. We always say if you\u2019re a fan of the Lakers, we want you to be a fan of the Sparks. I think a bigger part of this is this \u2018post-Title IX generation\u2019, and it\u2019s a lot of women like myself that grew up playing sports from an amateur to a professional level, and they want to watch the game that they know. Our ambition is to really pull that together, and that\u2019s what I think is really the opportunity here.\u201d\n\nObvious choice\n\nSomeone who also believes in this project is a two-time NBA champion and MVP Durant. Thirty Five Ventures was set up by Durant and his business partner Rich Kleiman. Overseeing his personal brand\u2019s creative content with Thirty Five Ventures is chief marketing officer Sarah Flynn. According to Flynn, the investment was an obvious choice for KD.\n\n\u201cI think anybody who knows and follows Kevin knows how supportive he is of the women\u2019s game and women\u2019s sports in general, but obviously, in particular, the WNBA. If you talk to any NBA player, they see WNBA players as their peers, they watch the games. They understand the physicality and the athleticism, and the style of play and how great female athletes, especially in the WNBA, are at just the fundamentals of basketball. If you are a pure basketball fan, you love the WNBA as much as you do the NBA. To them, it\u2019s just no question,\u201d explains Flynn.\n\nWhat we have in the women\u2019s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice\n\nSo, what was it about Just Women\u2019s Sports that caught the eye of one of basketball\u2019s all-time greats?\n\n\u201cI think when you look at the women\u2019s sports landscape, there are just some fundamental steps that have been skipped in terms of building those conversations and building those fandoms. Again, that\u2019s something that Just Women\u2019s Sports [is] trying to address.\n\n\u201cIf you look at where men\u2019s sports are, you\u2019re very used to getting those behind-the-scenes storylines about the athletes... you understand the world and the fashion and the personality and social justice [issues] as well as all of those things around the league... and you can contextualise those things because you understood those people as players first.\n\n\u201cWhat we have in the women\u2019s game is a lot of incredible conversations around equity and incredible conversations around social justice... you have a lot of people trying to do a lot of storytelling around who the women are as people, but you don\u2019t have enough storytelling about them as the players. You do not see the highlight reels. You\u2019re not seeing the highlights, and all of those fundamentals need to happen before you can truly build engaged fandoms.\u201d\n\nUnique opportunity\n\nIn Haley\u2019s eyes, Covid has given women\u2019s sports a unique opportunity, with everyone stuck at home. For a long time, the NWSL was the only league up and running. The WNBA\u2019s season opener saw a 63 per cent increase in viewership.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been asking and wanting more coverage, and for whatever reason with Covid, it just became unacceptable to not cover women\u2019s sports. I also think that with sports stopping and the NWSL was literally the only league in the US that was playing, they had a real opportunity, and they took full advantage of it. Then the WNBA did something similar too. I just feel like, with Covid, women\u2019s sports got a real chance. With that chance, it was undeniable that there was an audience and interest there, and that it was a really, really great product,\u201d reiterates Rosen.\n\nAccording to Flynn, while businesses may be looking for newer opportunities to promote their business, women\u2019s sport is the place to start.\n\n\u201cI think with announcements like ours and people like Kevin stepping up and supporting something like Just Women\u2019s Sports, other people are starting to get a little bit of Fomo, and there\u2019s that \u2018we don\u2019t want to miss out on what could be a huge investment. We got to get on the ball now, and we have to start covering the game.\u2019 You feel a little bit of that pressure behind the scenes in a really good and fun way.\u201d\n\nFor now, Rosen has her eye on the prize. She knows what she\u2019s looking to do with the investment. \u201cFor us, it\u2019s all about building the ecosystem of women\u2019s sports, getting people to tune in every week, every day, and just continuing to build the world of women\u2019s sports. That\u2019s really our goal.\u201d",

        "description": "America at Large: voice of the NBA has been routinely described as an icon, a legend",
        "articleBody": "All week long, the tributes have been coming for Marv Albert. The moment news leaked of his impending retirement as the voice of the NBA, he was being routinely described as an icon, a legend, one of the most storied broadcasters ever.\n\nIn the 58 years that have passed since he called his first New York Knicks\u2019 game at just 21, Albert became synonymous with the sport, his distinctive catchphrases segueing from the court into popular culture. The only jarring note was that quite a few paeans to his longevity somehow didn\u2019t see fit to mention his starring role in an especially lurid sexual assault case.\n\nIn May 1997, he was charged with forcible sodomy, biting a long-time lover multiple times on the back, and then forcing her to perform oral sex on him in a Virginia hotel room. According to the testimony of Vanessa Perhach, Albert was angry because, while he\u2019d been busy working the Knicks versus the Washington Bullets, she had failed to find another man to join them that evening for a threesome.\n\nIn the months between his arrest and the start of his trial, his name also turned up in the black book of Mistress Hilda Pierce, a New York city dominatrix who was mysteriously shot dead in her Upper West Side apartment.\n\nBorn Marvin Aufrichtig into a Hungarian family in Brooklyn, he got a job running errands for the Dodgers at 14, just before they alighted to Los Angeles. There followed a stint as a ball boy for the Knicks where he eventually became statistician to Marty Glickman, the famed commentator who got stuck in a blizzard one night in the winter of 1963 and sent word the kid now known as Marv Albert should take his mike for a game against the Celtics. He went on to cover umpteen Super Bowls, Stanley Cup finals, World Series. major boxing fights, and even Wimbledon.\n\nHis schedule was so over-packed that he titled his autobiography (ghosted by Rick Reilly), \u201cI\u2019d Love To, But I Have a Game . . . \u201d, the sentence he trotted out most to friends and family when explaining his absences. Then, at the peak of his career, he sent a text to Perhach, asking, \u201cWhen are we going to meet? Got somebody to take the tickets? And, oh, by the way, do you have somebody for the threesome?\u201d\n\nBoxing no longer has any excuse, it\u2019s American football injuries on steroids\nDon\u2019t expect golf to follow MLB\u2019s lead in latest US culture war\nAmerica at Large: The pitching padre who still holds a pair of dubious baseball records\n\nSuddenly, he was holding press conferences protesting his innocence and declaring the encounter to have been entirely consensual. The prosecution was requesting impressions of his teeth, legal experts were pointing out the maximum sentence he faced was life, and, through it all, his various employers stood resolutely by him as he awaited his day in court.\n\nThe proceedings began with an opening statement from the prosecution that included allegations Albert regularly beseeched Perhach to bring women\u2019s underwear for him to don during their encounters. On day two, she took the stand herself and told of his frequent requests to find men with large penises to join their fun. Salacious tabloid fodder that was not damning evidence of anything but his rather eclectic attitude in the bedroom. Then, in the best traditions of every courthouse drama, the prosecution sprung a surprise witness on the third day.\n\nPatricia Masten was a concierge with Hyatt Hotels who testified about being invited to Albert\u2019s suite one time in Texas to assist him sending a fax. When she got there, he emerged from the bathroom dressed in women\u2019s panties and a garter belt and forced himself on her. As she struggled under the attack, Albert started to bite her. Trying to wrestle free, she grabbed his toupee, lifting it clean off his head. At which point, clutching the wig, he ran from the room and she made good her escape.\n\nAmid speculation about whether his hairdresser might be called down from New York to testify about how the peculiar application of his rug made ripping it off impossible, Albert struck a deal the very next day. He pled guilty to assault and battery while the more serious felony charge of forcible sodomy was dropped.\n\nReputation rehab\n\n\u201cIn the past, there was consensual biting,\u201d said Albert, before the judge sentenced him to 12 months suspended, a $2,500 fine and psychological counselling. \u201cOn this particular evening, I did not realise until her testimony that she felt she was harmed. For that I am sorry.\u201d\n\nInitially fired from the airwaves, Albert\u2019s stay in professional purgatory was obscenely brief. Within weeks, a series of soft-focus media appearances began his reputation rehab. On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with Barbara Walters, he denied large portions of the case against him and called Perhach a liar. On \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d where he was a guest over 50 times, he declared the whole thing a set-up, motivated by his jealous accuser being aggrieved that he was marrying another woman.\n\n\u201cMan!\u201d joked Letterman. \u201cWow! The only thing I\u2019ve bitten during sex is my lower lip.\u201d\n\nThe audience lapped up the old pals\u2019 double act, guffawing throughout a 20-minute cameo spent downplaying the assault and disparaging Perhach. The contrived public relations blitz worked a treat. By the start of the next basketball season, Albert was back calling New York Knicks\u2019 games and, six months later, he returned to national television. As with so much of the fulsome praise of his career this past few days, it was like nothing untoward ever happened.",

And, oh, by the way, do you have somebody for the threesome?\u201d</p>\n\n<aside><ul>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked internal: /sport/other-sports/boxing-no-longer-has-any-excuse-it-s-american-football-injuries-on-steroids-1.4543714  (AUTOMATED)\" data-evt-label=\"Link 1 of 3 (10) on /sport/other-sports/tributes-to-marv-albert-overlook-role-in-sexual-assault-case-1.4568392 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/boxing-no-longer-has-any-excuse-it-s-american-football-injuries-on-steroids-1.4543714\">\n                                            Boxing no longer has any excuse, it\u2019s American football injuries on steroids\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked internal: /sport/other-sports/don-t-expect-golf-to-follow-mlb-s-lead-in-latest-us-culture-war-1.4530105  (AUTOMATED)\" data-evt-label=\"Link 2 of 3 (10) on /sport/other-sports/tributes-to-marv-albert-overlook-role-in-sexual-assault-case-1.4568392 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/don-t-expect-golf-to-follow-mlb-s-lead-in-latest-us-culture-war-1.4530105\">\n                                            Don\u2019t expect golf to follow MLB\u2019s lead in latest US culture war\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked internal: /sport/other-sports/america-at-large-the-pitching-padre-who-still-holds-a-pair-of-dubious-baseball-records-1.4524049  (AUTOMATED)\" data-evt-label=\"Link 3 of 3 (10) on /sport/other-sports/tributes-to-marv-albert-overlook-role-in-sexual-assault-case-1.4568392 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/america-at-large-the-pitching-padre-who-still-holds-a-pair-of-dubious-baseball-records-1.4524049\">\n                                            America at Large: The pitching padre who still holds a pair of dubious baseball records\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            </ul></aside>\n\n<p>Suddenly, he was holding press conferences protesting his innocence and declaring the encounter to have been entirely consensual. The prosecution was requesting impressions of his teeth, legal experts were pointing out the maximum sentence he faced was life, and, through it all, his various employers stood resolutely by him as he awaited his day in court.</p>\n\n<p>The proceedings began with an opening statement from the prosecution that included allegations Albert regularly beseeched Perhach to bring women\u2019s underwear for him to don during their encounters. On day two, she took the stand herself and told of his frequent requests to find men with large penises to join their fun. Salacious tabloid fodder that was not damning evidence of anything but his rather eclectic attitude in the bedroom. Then, in the best traditions of every courthouse drama, the prosecution sprung a surprise witness on the third day.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Patricia+Masten\">Patricia Masten</a> was a concierge with Hyatt Hotels who testified about being invited to Albert\u2019s suite one time in Texas to assist him sending a fax. When she got there, he emerged from the bathroom dressed in women\u2019s panties and a garter belt and forced himself on her. As she struggled under the attack, Albert started to bite her. Trying to wrestle free, she grabbed his toupee, lifting it clean off his head. At which point, clutching the wig, he ran from the room and she made good her escape.</p>\n\n<p>Amid speculation about whether his hairdresser might be called down from New York to testify about how the peculiar application of his rug made ripping it off impossible, Albert struck a deal the very next day. He pled guilty to assault and battery while the more serious felony charge of forcible sodomy was dropped.</p>\n\n<h2>Reputation rehab</h2>\n\n<p>\u201cIn the past, there was consensual biting,\u201d said Albert, before the judge sentenced him to 12 months suspended, a $2,500 fine and psychological counselling. \u201cOn this particular evening, I did not realise until her testimony that she felt she was harmed. For that I am sorry.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Initially fired from the airwaves, Albert\u2019s stay in professional purgatory was obscenely brief. Within weeks, a series of soft-focus media appearances began his reputation rehab. On \u201c60 Minutes\u201d with <a href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/topics/topics-7.1213540?article=true&amp;tag_person=Barbara+Walters\">Barbara Walters</a>, he denied large portions of the case against him and called Perhach a liar. On \u201cThe David Letterman Show\u201d where he was a guest over 50 times, he declared the whole thing a set-up, motivated by his jealous accuser being aggrieved that he was marrying another woman.</p>\n\n<p>\u201cMan!\u201d joked Letterman. \u201cWow! The only thing I\u2019ve bitten during sex is my lower lip.\u201d</p>\n\n<p>The audience lapped up the old pals\u2019 double act, guffawing throughout a 20-minute cameo spent downplaying the assault and disparaging Perhach. The contrived public relations blitz worked a treat. By the start of the next basketball season, Albert was back calling New York Knicks\u2019 games and, six months later, he returned to national television. As with so much of the fulsome praise of his career this past few days, it was like nothing untoward ever happened.</p>\n\n</article>",

        "articleBody": "There was something of that oft-quoted line from Field of Dreams around the small stadium track at Crean Lutheran High School track in Irvine, California, last weekend: If you build it, they will come.\n\nThis was the venue for the Sound Running Track Meet, nestled somewhere beneath the Californian hills, all hidden away from any curious onlookers or anyone hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the best American runners around. Plus a few internationals who have been training in one of the many altitude training camp locations around the US.\n\nIn other ways there was an aura about the place, an opportunity and event that athletes felt they would miss out on if they simply don\u2019t come.\n\nAltitude training seems to be essential these days, with athletes training in Park City, Utah, Flagstaff, Arizona and Boulder, Colorado to name a few. US athletes don\u2019t think much of dropping down for a race to test themselves, but also to check their progress, as many are aiming for the US Olympic trials in just one month\u2019s time at the newly renovated Hayward Field in Eugene, Oregon \u2013 which will also host the World Athletics Championships in 2022.\n\nI\u2019m based in Park City with a group of Nike-sponsored athletes, and we made the trek to Irvine the afternoon before the 1,500 metres and 800 metre races were scheduled to take part.\n\nThere were a couple of 10,000 metres on the Friday night, with athletes urgently chasing Olympic qualifying standards, and also US athletes having to meet Olympic trial entry standards.\n\nThe Sound Running Track Meet is an independent race series that attracts athletes of all levels from high school runners to Olympic champions, and everyone is treated equally. Everyone must pay their entry fee, organise their own travel, accommodation and transfers between airport and hotel and track.\n\nLogistical measures\n\nWhen you are used to the luxury of similar events in Europe, where athletes have all these logistical measures taken care of, it seems even more of an ordeal for athletes to travel from all over the US just to get the opportunity to race in an environment with perfect conditions. All the races are seeded, with pace-makers aiming for specific times to help get the races under way.\n\nSonia O\u2019Sullivan: Back at Nike HQ there\u2019s more than sit-ups between runs\nSonia O\u2019Sullivan: What should be the exact role of high performance?\nSonia O\u2019Sullivan: Taking up a new lifelong lesson in bodybuilding\n\nYou can also understand why these are not races where athletes just run around for the win, but come with purpose and determination to deliver a positive result early season. No longer are the early season races a place to come and awaken the competitive juices; they are a place where you need to be ready to run fast from the start.\n\nI\u2019ve previously watched these Sound Running events online from Australia in 2020 when there were even fewer race opportunities for athletes. I was curious about what it was that drew the athletes to these micro meets.\n\nThere was the added requirement of a negative Covid test result or proof of full vaccination to be submitted online within seven days of the event so you could get your name on the list. Athletes warming up and racing were exempt from wearing a mask until they were finished their events.\n\nWe left Park City at 1pm; the travel was five hours door-to-door including the one-hour time difference. The most stressful part was the line to get through security, since our last flight two weeks ago the passenger numbers at US airports have exploded. Just when I was getting used to that free middle seat, there is not an empty seat on the plane.\n\nIt was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times\n\nThe pre-race jog and strides were completed earlier in the morning at the Park City High School track, just dinner and sleep required before the morning races that began at 11am.\n\nIt\u2019s unusual for a track meet to have a morning schedule, but the event was shown live on ESPN, and getting national TV coverage is a huge bonus for track and field in America; it probably helped that it\u2019s an Olympic year.\n\nAs much as I was expecting the energy of a big track meet due to the calibre of athletes in attendance, it was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times.\n\nThe world of athletics has changed so much in recent years, and it seems times are all that matter. It\u2019s nice to win, but these are not the important races; these are races with the main purpose to deliver a time that helps the athlete progress to the next level and then make the cut, as only so many can be selected to run in Tokyo this summer.\n\nYou really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd\n\nThere was some prize money, partially funded by the livestream which had a pay-per-view, hoping to attract more viewers in the knowledge that they were contributing to the prize pool.\n\nThe loud music filled the silence between races but when the music was stopped you could hear a pin drop. You could hear the athletes\u2019 spikes sticking to the track and the breathing as athletes pushed themselves, finding some reward for all the hours and weeks of training. It may seem like early season but things are about to ramp up, with meet after meet appearing on the calendar not just here but across Europe.\n\nYou really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd. This felt like an audience of well-informed athletics anoraks, assessing the form and weighing things up for more important races down the track.\n\nJust six weeks to the Olympic qualifying deadline, the US Olympic trials, which normally attract Olympic-size crowds, will be a more subdued affair this year for the fans. But for the athletes it will be no less important, where everything is on the line for those top-three spots. Most countries will have their national championships also in June and teams will be selected \u2013 and then the logistics of how the Tokyo Olympics will be played out will become more of a reality.\n\nThere is an obvious shift in the times athletes are running. In this one meet alone, there\u2019s a world leading time, national records, personal bests, and qualifying times, but you do wonder how the races will play out in the Olympics when there are qualifying rounds and medals at stake. Will the lap times be so consistent, allowing greater spread of energy across the length of the race, or will there be a return to more tactical racing? It\u2019s never easy to predict because to take on a race also takes bravery.",

All the races are seeded, with pace-makers aiming for specific times to help get the races under way.</p>\n\n<aside><ul>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked internal: /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-back-at-nike-hq-there-s-more-than-sit-ups-between-runs-1.4556460 \" data-evt-label=\"Link 1 of 3 (9) on /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-athletes-come-running-to-this-field-of-olympic-dreams-in-california-1.4569688 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-back-at-nike-hq-there-s-more-than-sit-ups-between-runs-1.4556460\">\n                                            Sonia O\u2019Sullivan: Back at Nike HQ there\u2019s more than sit-ups between runs\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked soa: /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-what-should-be-the-exact-role-of-high-performance-1.4543751  - Premium\" data-evt-label=\"Link 2 of 3 (9) on /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-athletes-come-running-to-this-field-of-olympic-dreams-in-california-1.4569688 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-what-should-be-the-exact-role-of-high-performance-1.4543751\">\n                                            Sonia O\u2019Sullivan: What should be the exact role of high performance?\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            <li>\n                                        <a data-evt-category=\"Related links\" data-evt-action=\"Clicked internal: /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-taking-up-a-new-lifelong-lesson-in-bodybuilding-1.4519094 \" data-evt-label=\"Link 3 of 3 (9) on /sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-athletes-come-running-to-this-field-of-olympic-dreams-in-california-1.4569688 (instream)\" href=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/other-sports/sonia-o-sullivan-taking-up-a-new-lifelong-lesson-in-bodybuilding-1.4519094\">\n                                            Sonia O\u2019Sullivan: Taking up a new lifelong lesson in bodybuilding\n                                        </a>\n                                    </li>\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                </ul></aside>\n\n<p>You can also understand why these are not races where athletes just run around for the win, but come with purpose and determination to deliver a positive result early season. No longer are the early season races a place to come and awaken the competitive juices; they are a place where you need to be ready to run fast from the start.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ve previously watched these Sound Running events online from Australia in 2020 when there were even fewer race opportunities for athletes. I was curious about what it was that drew the athletes to these micro meets.</p>\n\n<p>There was the added requirement of a negative Covid test result or proof of full vaccination to be submitted online within seven days of the event so you could get your name on the list. Athletes warming up and racing were exempt from wearing a mask until they were finished their events.</p>\n\n<p>We left Park City at 1pm; the travel was five hours door-to-door including the one-hour time difference. The most stressful part was the line to get through security, since our last flight two weeks ago the passenger numbers at US airports have exploded. Just when I was getting used to that free middle seat, there is not an empty seat on the plane.</p>\n\n<blockquote>It was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times</blockquote>\n\n<p>The pre-race jog and strides were completed earlier in the morning at the Park City High School track, just dinner and sleep required before the morning races that began at 11am.</p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s unusual for a track meet to have a morning schedule, but the event was shown live on ESPN, and getting national TV coverage is a huge bonus for track and field in America; it probably helped that it\u2019s an Olympic year.</p>\n\n<p>As much as I was expecting the energy of a big track meet due to the calibre of athletes in attendance, it was more like an organised training session where all the different athlete training groups worked together to push each other to fast times.</p>\n\n<p>The world of athletics has changed so much in recent years, and it seems times are all that matter. It\u2019s nice to win, but these are not the important races; these are races with the main purpose to deliver a time that helps the athlete progress to the next level and then make the cut, as only so many can be selected to run in Tokyo this summer.</p>\n\n<blockquote>You really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd</blockquote>\n\n<p>There was some prize money, partially funded by the livestream which had a pay-per-view, hoping to attract more viewers in the knowledge that they were contributing to the prize pool.</p>\n\n<p>The loud music filled the silence between races but when the music was stopped you could hear a pin drop. You could hear the athletes\u2019 spikes sticking to the track and the breathing as athletes pushed themselves, finding some reward for all the hours and weeks of training. It may seem like early season but things are about to ramp up, with meet after meet appearing on the calendar not just here but across Europe.</p>\n\n<p>You really do miss the cheering and clapping from an enthusiastic crowd. This felt like an audience of well-informed athletics anoraks, assessing the form and weighing things up for more important races down the track.</p>\n\n<p>Just six weeks to the Olympic qualifying deadline, the US Olympic trials, which normally attract Olympic-size crowds, will be a more subdued affair this year for the fans. But for the athletes it will be no less important, where everything is on the line for those top-three spots. Most countries will have their national championships also in June and teams will be selected \u2013 and then the logistics of how the Tokyo Olympics will be played out will become more of a reality.</p>\n\n<p>There is an obvious shift in the times athletes are running. In this one meet alone, there\u2019s a world leading time, national records, personal bests, and qualifying times, but you do wonder how the races will play out in the Olympics when there are qualifying rounds and medals at stake. Will the lap times be so consistent, allowing greater spread of energy across the length of the race, or will there be a return to more tactical racing? It\u2019s never easy to predict because to take on a race also takes bravery.</p>\n\n</article>",

        "articleBody": "About The Irish Times\n\nThe Irish Times has delivered top quality news, opinion and analysis since it was first published in 1859. As media technologies evolve, so do our methods of storytelling and delivery. The Irish Times continues the transition from print to multiplatform publication, while upholding the journalistic principles that earned it the reputation as Ireland\u2019s paper of reference.\n\nOn this page, you can learn about the principles of The Irish Times, its history and the governing body that guarantees the independence and quality of the newspaper, The Irish Times Trust.\n\nPrinciples of The Irish Times\n\nThe Irish Times upholds the following principles:\n\nThe support of constitutional democracy expressed through governments freely elected;\nThe progressive achievement of social justice between people and the discouragement of discrimination of all kinds;\nThe promotion of a friendly society where the quality of life is enriched by the standards of its education, its art, its culture and its recreational facilities, and where the quality of spirit is instinct with Christian values, but free from all religious bias and discrimination;\nThe promotion of peace and tolerance and opposition to all forms of violence and hatred, so that each man may live in harmony with his neighbour, considerate for his cultural, material and spiritual needs;\nThe promotion of understanding of other nations and peoples and a sympathetic concern for their wellbeing;\nIn pursuance of the foregoing and to enable readers of The Irish Times to reach informed and independent judgements and to contribute more effectively to the life of the community, the following principles govern the publication of The Irish Times: news shall be as accurate and as comprehensive as is practicable and be presented fairly; comment and opinion shall be informed and responsible, and shall be identifiable from fact; and special consideration shall be given to the reasonable representation of minority interests and divergent views.\n\nHistory of The Irish Times\n\n1859: Major Lawrence Knox, a man in his early 20s, establishes The Irish Times.\nMarch 29 th, 1859: The first edition of The Irish Times is published at No. 4 Lower Abbey Street, Dublin 1 as a \u2018new conservative daily paper\u2019. For 14 weeks, it is published every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.\nJune 8 th, 1859: The Irish Times becomes a daily newspaper. It was one of 10 Irish newspapers available at the time, and the only of which that survives to this day.\n1873: The Arnott family buy The Irish Times following the death of its founder. The paper\u2019s politics shift from Protestant nationalist to unionist.\n1895: The company moves to D\u2019Olier Street, leading to \u2018the Old Lady of D\u2019Olier Street\u2019 moniker.\n1900: The Irish Times becomes a public company, but the Arnott family continue as majority shareholders until the 1960s.\n1922: The Irish Free State is established and The Irish Times shifts to an independent political line.\n1974: A Trust is formed with the objective of securing and maintaining The Irish Times as \u2018an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland, free from any form of personal or party political, commercial, religious or other sectional control\u2019.\n1994: The Irish Times becomes the first newspaper in the British Isles and one of 30 worldwide to establish a website.\n1999: The Irish Times begins publishing its online edition on ireland.com.\n2006: The company moves to its current location on Tara Street.\n2008: The print and online newsrooms are integrated and the website moves from ireland.com to irishtimes.com.\nNovember 5 th, 2012: The new-look Irish Times is launched. Changes to the paper include narrower pages, colour-coded sections, more use of photographs and graphics and more extensive, original journalism.\n\nMessage from the Editor, Paul O'Neill\n\nSome 650,000 readers enter into a contract with the journalists of irishtimes.com and The Irish Times newspaper every day. The overriding duty of Irish Times journalists is to those readers. They access our digital content using a variety of devices or buy the newspaper on the understanding that they will be offered journalism of the highest standard; reports that are accurate and comprehensive; and analysis that is informed, fair and based on the facts.\n\nIrish Times journalists face a challenging task every day to live up to the standards set for ourselves and our readers. The Irish Times Trust and its Articles of Association give the newspaper and its website a special position among media organisations by protecting its editorial content from commercial and other sectional interests.\n\nThe reputation of The Irish Times is based, first and foremost, on reporting the news. We seek to produce journalism that provides insight, context, explanation, clarity and a unique take on Ireland and on the world \u2013 with the highest standards of independence, accuracy, fairness and clarity. We aspire to being a trusted source of information whether it\u2019s in print, on web, mobile or tablet device.\n\nThe Irish Times with irishtimes.com is an authoritative and independent commentator and analyst on important events in the affairs of Ireland - North and South - Britain, the European Union, the United States and the wider world. We are the only Irish news organisation with a network of correspondents around the world, who provide a view of the world through Irish eyes.\n\nThe Irish Times is the most important national forum for thinkers and doers in Irish society. We offer a platform for critical, constructive and divergent comment in the different spheres including business, politics and public affairs, culture, the environment, health and education. We have moved in recent years from being a newspaper of record to a newspaper of reference.\n\nThe Irish Times occupies a special position as a pacemaker for change in the society which it serves. We are prepared to champion specific causes, as we have always done, while recognising that these causes have changed over the past decade. We may present our readers with unpalatable realities on occasions, but we do not employ shock tactics for their own sake.

It was set up as \u2018a company limited by guarantee\u2019 to purchase The Irish Times Limited and to ensure that The Irish Times would be published as an independent newspaper with specific editorial objectives.\n\nThe Trust is regulated by the Memorandum and Articles of Association and controlled by a body of people (the Governors) under company law. It is not a charity and does not have charitable status. It has no beneficial shareholders and it cannot pay dividends. Any profits made by The Irish Times cannot be distributed to the Trust; they must be used to strengthen the newspaper, directly and/or indirectly.\n\nThe Trust is composed of a maximum of 11 Governors, who are appointed on the basis that they are \u2018representative broadly of the community throughout the whole of Ireland\u2019.\n\nThe Trust is a key component in the governance structure of The Irish Times because it guarantees the independence and quality of the newspaper. It is not involved in the day-to-day management of the Company. The primary role of the Trust is to appoint a Board, which is responsible for ensuring that the Company is run successfully and adheres to its core objects. The Trust will intervene only if there is a material threat \u2013 financial or otherwise \u2013 to the attainment of the main objective of publishing The Irish Times as an independent newspaper. The Company is required to seek Trust approval for significant disposals or acquisitions.\n\nGroup structure\n\nIn 1974, a Trust was established with the objective of securing and maintaining The Irish Times as \u2018an independent newspaper primarily concerned with serious issues for the benefit of the community throughout the whole of Ireland, free from any form of personal or party political, commercial, religious or other sectional control\u2019.\n\nThis is the core objective set out by the legal document \u2013 the Memoranda and Articles of Association \u2013 that regulates both The Irish Times Trust CLG (the Trust) and The Irish Times DAC (the Company). The Memorandum and Articles also give substantial protection to The Irish Times against a takeover.\n\nComposed of a maximum of 11 Governors, the Trust is responsible for appointing a Board to ensure that the Company is run successfully and adheres to its core objects. Both the Trust and the Board share the responsibility of ensuring the editorial independence and financial viability of The Irish Times, but they do not interfere with the ordinary activities or decisions (commercial or editorial) of each other. They are differentiated mainly by functions of ownership and operation. In the event of any serious disagreement within the Board, the three directors nominated by the Trust may be deemed to have 50 per cent of all votes plus one. This provision can only come into operation on the basis of legal advice that certifies the matter to be of \u2018significant policy\u2019 under the Memorandum and Articles of Association.\n\nThe Trust\n\nCaitriona Murphy\n\nConsultant; former Chair of the Investor Compensation Company, the Labour Relations Commission and Praesta Ireland\n\nPeter McLoone\n\nBoard member of the Labour Relations Commission; former general secretary of Impact; former president of Ictu\n\nBarry Smyth\n\nHolds the Digital Chair of Computer Science at University College Dublin; elected member of the Royal Irish Academy\n\nConor Houston\n\nProgramme Director, Centre for Democracy & Peace Building\n\nCatherine Day\n\nFormer Secretary General of the European Commission; special adviser to the President of the European Commission\n\nJoanne Stuart\n\nCEO Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance; former Director of Development at Catalyst Inc; NI chair of the US-NI Mentorship Program\n\nMarguerite Sayers\n\nExecutive Director for Customer Solutions with ESB; former Managing Director of ESB Networks DAC; past President of Engineers Ireland\n\nEdmond Harty\n\nAdjunct Full Professor at UCD; previously CEO of Dairymaster; Fellow of the Irish Academy of Engineering and former EY Entrepreneur of the Year\n\nThe Board\n\nThe Board is currently made up of eleven directors who are appointed by the Trust.

However, the data does nudge the analysis towards a reasonable starting point when it comes to evaluating team and player contributions.\n\nReflecting on the season-ending statistics of the recently completed Guinness Pro14 tournament with a view to compiling a team of the season from featured Irish players, this column was immediately struck by how, if any, different that side might be based on personal recollection of performances.\n\nIt is never more clearly illustrated than in choosing a fullback. Ulster\u2019s Michael Lowry features prominently in a number of categories relating to attack including \u201cdefenders beaten\u201d where he is ranked third (35) across all teams and was an impressive attacking catalyst for his team.\n\nObviously the number of matches played in the tournament is an important metric when assessing a player\u2019s contribution and primarily for that reason there is a weighting in qualification terms for the most part against Ireland squad members.\n\nJimmy O\u2019Brien (Leinster), like Lowry, acclimatised beautifully to a less familiar role, but it would be difficult to argue against Mike Haley as the standout Irish player in that position. The Munster fullback enjoyed a brilliant season, a sharp counter-attacking threat to complement his aerial skills. He was at the hub of the province\u2019s better performances en route to the final.\n\nClean breaks\n\nTaking the wings as a pair, Alex Wootton (Connacht) and Dave Kearney (Leinster) fulfil all the criteria when it comes to stats and performances. Wootton (nine) was one of three players at the top of the tournament try scoring table with Kearney, one behind on eight. Kearney was third (19) in \u201cclean breaks\u201d with Wootton (18) fourth; the same position overall for the Connacht wing (34) in \u201cdefenders beaten\u201d.\n\nGoing strictly on statistical data, Ulster\u2019s talented young centre Stewart Moore features more prominently than any other centre, but in terms of performances values Connacht\u2019s Tom Daly would be a shoo-in at inside centre, while by the same token James Hume (Ulster) probably deserves the 13 jersey in the putative team.\n\nJack Carty, Conor Fitzgerald, JJ Hanrahan and Ben Healy all feature prominently across a number of metrics, but Leinster\u2019s Harry Byrne, playing in a largely dominant team, just edges his rivals in employing that specific yardstick, particularly in the playmaking capacity; albeit acknowledging the scope to strongly argue for any of the aforementioned quartet.\n\nIn any other season, Luke McGrath\u2019s numbers/performances and ditto for Caolin Blade would make them irresistible candidates at scrumhalf, but Ulster\u2019s John Cooney is unassailable. He was the leading points scorer (115) in the tournament, had the most try assists (13) and made the most clean breaks (22) while a standout player for his team.\n\nLeinster props Peter Dooley and Michael Bent scored three tries apiece, a healthy contribution to supplement their work in more mundane chores, including playing an important role in a dominant Leinster scrum. Bent, who retires at the end of the season, will be missed, the epitome of a team player.\n\nConnacht hooker Shane Delahunt facilitated the most lineout wins (139), Dan Sheehan (Leinster) scored the most tries (six), Kevin O\u2019Byrne (Munster) may have been reincarnated as a hooker from a previous life as an outhalf but according to the statistics James Tracy Leinster) was the most visible across multiple categories.\n\nInjuries to Iain Henderson, Sam Carter, David O\u2019Connor and Cormac Izuchukwu meant that Ulster were forced to rely heavily on Kieran Treadwell and Alan O\u2019Connor, and it is the Skerries man\u2019s durability that made him a strong contender along with Ross Molony, Devin Toner, Jean Kleyn, Billy Holland, Fineen Wycherley and several young aspirants.\n\nQuality candidates\n\nHowever the body of work offered by Gavin Thornbury and Ultan Dillane is impossible to ignore with the latter consistently excellent and arguably playing as well as he has ever done. Any discussion about the backrow in Irish rugby is oversubscribed in terms of quality candidates.\n\nHow can you possibly ignore Ulster\u2019s Nick Timoney, Connacht\u2019s Paul Boyle or Leinster\u2019s Josh Murphy, who were individually outstanding or any one of Sean Reidy, Jordi Murphy, Jack O\u2019Donoghue and Conor Oliver? But there is no room for argument based on the statistics.\n\nRhys Ruddock, who spent the early part of the season as a number eight, has had to reinforce his mantelpiece based on the number of man-of-the-match accolades while Scott Penny is the co-leading try scorer (nine) in the tournament alongside Wootton and Marcell Coetzee and features in several other categories.\n\nIt\u2019s very much the same for Munster number eight Gavin Coombes, whose excellence is likely to be rewarded with a first Ireland cap in the summer as may be the case with Penny.\n\nThe team below is largely based on statistical data, except when it is not!\n\nAn Irish Pro14 team of the season\n\n15 Mike Haley (Munster)\n\n14 Alex Wootton (Connacht)\n\n13 James Hume (Ulster)\n\n12 Tom Daly (Connacht)\n\n11 Dave Kearney (Leinster)\n\n10 Harry Byrne (Leinster)\n\n9 John Cooney (Ulster)\n\n1 Peter Dooley (Leinster)\n\n2 James Tracy (Leinster)\n\n3 Michael Bent (Leinster)\n\n4 Ultan Dillane (Connacht)\n\n5 Gavin Thornbury (Connacht)\n\n6 Rhys Ruddock (Leinster)\n\n7 Scott Penny (Leinster)",
