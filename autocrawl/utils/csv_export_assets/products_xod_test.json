A constant aperture of 2.8 through the zoom range makes this a highly versatile tool and a brand new Optical Stabilization (OS) system helps compensate for camera shake. Though a common focal length, the Sigma 24-70mm Art brings a new level of usability and durability featuring a rugged metal barrel and an emphasis on image quality. Building off the experience from the 12-24mm Art, the aspherical elements used in the 24-70mm F2.8 OS Art undergo a highly precise level of polishing, producing elements thicker in the center than on the edges. This process creates stunning image quality and beautiful circular bokeh. Like each and every Global Vision Lens, the Sigma 24-70mm F2.8 DG HSM OS Art is handcrafted at our single factory in Aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigmas facility.",

        "description": "Supreme lightweight portability that makes telephoto shooting fun Uncompromising image quality with 15 elements in 10 groups that lets you focus on creativity Up-close shooting performance (31.5\" / 1:9.4 Wide & 59.1\" / 1:5.1 Tele) Moisture-Resistant Construction Tamron USA 6 Year Limited Warranty on new lenses if purchased from Tamron Authorized USA Dealer Zoom into the world of telephoto The world's smallest and lightest* telephoto zoom lens for Sony full-frame E-mount mirrorless cameras The 70-300mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III RXD (Model A047) for Sony full-frame E-mount mirrorless cameras is a telephoto zoom lens designed and created so photographers of all skill levels can enjoy high quality images comfortably. Tamrons new 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 covers a broad telephoto zoom range yet is the world's smallest size and lightest weight, coming in at 148mm (5.8 in) long with a maximum diameter of 77mm, and weighing just 545g (19.2 oz). With special emphasis on resolving power, Tamron has deployed special lens elements appropriately arranged to correct chromatic aberration, generally very strong in a telephoto lens, as well as other aberrations. Users can enjoy high-resolution images combined with the stunning bokeh qualities that are achievable only with a telephoto lens. The lens also incorporates the RXD (Rapid eXtra-silent stepping Drive) stepping motor unit, a high-speed precision AF drive system that is remarkably quiet. Tamron's Moisture-Resistant Construction provides extra protection, while various features that are built into Sony mirrorless cameras, including \"Eye AF,\" are supported. The 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 is a versatile lens for photographing landscapes, sports and other action, pets and wildlife and more. The lens also demonstrates its potential for portrait shooting, casual snapshots and scenarios that require you to be mobile and shoot handheld, like sporting events. The apparent image compression and the close-up effects characteristic of telephoto lenses naturally amplify photographic expression. Zooming in on distant objects and making them appear closer is one of the joys of telephoto shooting. This zoom lens provides an entryway into that new world. *Among 300mm-capable telephoto zoom lenses for full-frame mirrorless cameras (As of August, 2020: Tamron) A high-resolution telephoto zoom lens for Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras that is powerful, portable, and fun To make the 300mm telephoto focal length more fun and accessible, Tamron focused intently on designing a telephoto zoom lens thats both small and lightweight. Turning the conventional concept of a telephoto lens on its head, the 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 is only 148mm (5.8 in) in length with a maximum diameter of 77mm and a weight of just 545g (19.2 oz). This gives users the freedom to concentrate fully on shooting without worrying about lens size or weight. In addition to those wishing to pursue real telephoto shooting for the first time, the lens is also recommended for people who use cameras that have built-in image stabilization because they can leave the tripod at home. Of special significance, when paired with the APS-C sized E-mount Sony cameras, this zoom adds additional telephoto reach and still remains comfortable to handle. Users can enjoy shooting with even higher power telephoto effects at a maximum equivalent focal length of approximately 450mm*. *For APS-C mirrorless format: 105-450mm equivalent field-of-view Achieves the ultimate combination of light weight and outstanding optical performance The 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 zooms optical design was refined via thorough simulations utilizing the latest technologies. With high priority on reduced size and weight, Tamron selected the aperture of F6.3 for the telephoto end to achieve a slim lens barrel and outstanding lightness. Taking the weight savings even further, we used a specially treated, high-strength aluminum-magnesium alloy*, the first time Tamron has used this material in the mount components of a lens for full-frame mirrorless cameras. The new design maintains excellent strength while successfully reducing weight to around 68% of previous mounts. The lens is made up of 15 elements in 10 groups with an appropriate arrangement of LD (Low Dispersion) lens elements. Eliminating waste to the extreme degree, Tamron reduced weight while still achieving very high image quality in the 70-300mm F4.5-6.3. Aberrations such as axial chromatic aberration (which tends to occur in telephoto lens designs) have been well corrected. The 300mm end, which receives particularly frequent use in a telephoto zoom, provides excellent high-resolution performance from the center of the image all the way to the corners. Stunning bokeh (intentional background blur qualities) are another remarkable feature of this new lens. Subjects are accentuated against the beautifully soft bokeh effects in the background. To suppress ghosting and flare, the lens uses Tamron's BBAR (Broad-Brand Anti-Reflection) Coating, which is renowned for its anti-reflection performance. In addition, the actuation of the lens correction features built into Sony cameras lets users enjoy enhanced performance and functions. *High-strength aluminum-magnesium alloy: An alloy mainly comprised of aluminum with a high magnesium content. High performance autofocus system means you'll own every shooting opportunity The AF drive on the 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 includes an RXD motor unit to help you stay focused on the action. RXD uses an actuator to precisely control the rotational angle of the motor, allowing it to directly drive the focusing lens without passing through a reduction gear. A sensor that precisely detects the position of the lens enables high-speed and accurate AF, which is ideal when shooting continually moving subjects or recording video. And with a focusing system that is both smooth and quiet, the 70-300mm F4.5-6.3 lets you shoot free from stress not worrying the drive sound in a quiet environment. The 70-300mm F/4.5-6.3 Di III RXD (Model A047) for Sony full-frame E-mount mirrorless cameras is a telephoto zoom lens designed and created so photographers of all skill levels can enjoy high quality images comfortably.

Its ideal for a wide variety of photos, including snapshots while strolling, night shots (thanks to the bright maximum aperture) and portraits with superb background/foreground blur. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2012 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

The first Sony G Lens created specifically for E-mount cameras is true to its heritage, achieving outstanding resolution and contrast throughout the zoom range thanks to an advanced optical design incorporating two ED glass elements and three aspherical elements. From wide angle to medium telephoto, this power zoom lens covers approximately a 6x zoom range with a constant F4 aperture. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2013 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

The lens has a large maximum aperture of F2.8 at 28mm wide end, which represents a worlds first* for all-in-one zoom lenses, and delivers high-level performance across the entire zoom range, from the 28mm wide-angle end to 200mm telephoto. Despite covering a wide range of focal lengths, the lens is lightweight and compact, with a length of 117mm (4.6 in) and a weight of 575g (20.3 oz). Aside from day-to-day portability, the 28-200mm F2.8-5.6s lightweight and compact size make it especially convenient for travel photos, where users wish to avoid the burden of heavy baggage. Tamron has also taken an uncompromising approach to optical performance, making liberal use of special lens elementsincluding LD (Low Dispersion) and XLD (eXtra Low Dispersion) to greatly suppress chromatic aberrations, and making it possible to achieve high image quality from edge to edge. With an MOD (Minimum Object Distance) of 0.19m (7.5 in) at the wide end and 0.8m (31.5 in) at the telephoto end, the lens also offers high-level close-up shooting performance. The AF drive system is powered by the RXD (Rapid eXtra-silent stepping Drive) stepping motor unit to deliver high-speed, high-precision performance. The lens also features Moisture-Resistant Construction and Fluorine Coating for added protection. When it comes to all-in-one zooms, the innovative 28-200mm F2.8-5.6 is in a class by itself and vividly captures virtually all possible scenes, from landscape photography to portrait photos and snapshots. Among currently available all-in-one zoom lenses for interchangeable lens cameras (zoom ratio of 7x or higher) (As of May 2020: Tamron) Maximum aperture at the 28mm setting is a blazing fast F2.8 The 28-200mm F2.8-5.6 is the first*1 all-in-one zoom lens for full-frame mirrorless cameras to offer a maximum aperture of F2.8.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Aperture range: f/1.4 - f/16 35mm film/ full-frame digital sensor Format Hyper-sonic motor focusing (HSM) A true flagship of artistic expression One of SIGMA's finest creations yet, this lens sets a new benchmark for performance, offering quality that exceeds expectations in every way. Designed with a focus on sophisticated optical performance and tremendous expressive power, our new Art line of lenses delivers top-level image quality. With unsurpassed expressive performance, these lenses reach the high standards demanded by photographers with an artistic, creative inclination. Along with landscapes, portraits, still-life, close-up and casual snaps, they're perfect for the kind of photography that unleashes the inner artist. Ideal for studio photography, they offer just as much expressive scope when capturing architecture, starry skies, underwater shots and many other scenes. The full realization of the Art concept, the 35mm F1.4 DG HSM is the perfect flagship. Hold it in your own hands and appreciate it with your own eyes. Brass made bayonet mount This lens incorporates a brass made bayonet mount which has both high accuracy and durability. A special treatment to reinforce its strength is applied to the surface giving it greater strength and making it highly resistant to long-term use. High resolution with beautiful bokeh effects Minimal distortion combined with beautiful bokeh effects at large-aperture settings. The aspheric lens at the front of the lens series helps minimize both distortion and vignetting. The rounded diaphragm produces an attractive round bokeh effect at large-aperture settings. Optimized power distribution minimizes sagittal coma flare. Coma of point light sources near the edge of the image and axial chromatic aberration are both minimized, making the lens an excellent choice for photographing nighttime landscapes and heavenly bodies. Smooth bokeh and minimised flare. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. From an early stage in the lens design process, flare and ghosting have been measured to establish an optical design resistant to strong incident light sources such as backlighting. SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting to help photographers produce sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions. The included lens hood can be attached to block out extraneous light, which can have a negative effect on rendering performance. Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer. Floating system This system adjusts the distance between lens groups during focusing, thereby reducing the amount of lens movement required. The result is less aberration at different shooting distances. Benefits are particularly great in macro lenses because they cover a wide range of shooting distances, and in wide-angle lenses, which employ asymmetric configurations of lens elements. Compatible with full-frame Sony E-mount cameras The version of this lens compatible with Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras contains the same optical system as for SLRs. SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11 is not required, as the lens performs the same functions as the converter, including in-camera image stabilization and in-camera lens aberration correction. In addition, the lens is compatible with Sonys Continuous AF, which is not addressed by MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11. SIGMA plans to offer over time Sony E-mount versions of every full-frame prime lens currently available in the Art line, from 14mm to 135mm.Note: This product is developed, manufactured and sold based on the specifications of E-mount which was disclosed by Sony Corporation under the license agreement with Sony Supplied Accessories Padded Case CS0330 (CS0359 for Sony E fitting) LENS HOOD LH730-03 FRONT CAP LCF  67mm REAR CAP LCR  *The lens hood cuts harmful rays that can negatively affect photographs while also minimizing reflectivity within the hood itself. The hood also features a rubber construction and a non-slip groove to make it easy to hold in a variety of shooting situations. SIGMA WR CERAMIC PROTECTOR 67mm (OPTIONAL) With many applications in aerospace and other industries, glass ceramic is an extremely tough type of crystallized glass that serves as the foundation for Clear Glass Ceramic. While featuring the high transmittance required of optical devices, this advanced new material combines greater hardness than chemically strengthened glass and greater flexibility than sapphire crystal glass. These qualities make Clear Glass Ceramic the ideal material for protective lens filters.

Perfect for video capture Product Description Wide zoom range (82 - 315mm 35mm equivalent) ideal for sports or natureInternal focusing for smooth, quiet operation - perfect for video capture. Get an amazingly high quality E-mount zoom lens with Optical SteadyShot image stabilization perfect for taking along to your next sports game or on adventure in the great outdoors. Align the white index on the lens barrel with the white index on the camera (mounting index), then insert the lens into the camera mount and rotate it clockwise until it locks. From the Manufacturer    E 55-210mm F4.5-6.3 OSS Zoom Lens  This 55-210mm lens offers a superb balance of form and function: ample zoom range in a compact design that is lightweight and remarkably comfortable to hold and operate. Built-in Optical SteadyShot image stabilization system makes it possible to produce sharp images even when shooting handheld in low light.       Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass  As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.    Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.         Lens-based optical image stabilization  Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.    Additional Features   Internal focusing  Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter.     2014 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

It features an MOD (Minimum Object Distance) of 0.19m (7.5 in) at the wide-angle end and 0.39m (15.4 in) at the telephoto end. The lens is equipped with Tamrons RXD (Rapid eXtra-silent stepping Drive) AF drive system, a high-speed, precision stepping motor unit. It also incorporates a wide variety of other features, including Moisture-Resistant Construction and Fluorine Coating for added durability. In your everyday life and on your trips to distant places, this lens captures all the excitement and discoveries with the finest possible detail. *Di III-A is the new designation for Tamron's line of lenses exclusively for APS-C mirrorless cameras. Fast F2.8 aperture available throughout the entire zoom range The 17-70mm F2.8 maintains its large F2.8 maximum aperture throughout the entire zoom range (unlike variable aperture lenses that darken as you zoom). Thanks to F2.8 and high optical performance, 17-70mm F2.8 allows you to capture your subjects with clear details from wide angle to telephoto. The three main advantages of a large F2.8 aperture are: A) ability to shoot successfully in lower light levels, B) beautiful and dreamy bokeh, and C) better control of depth-of-field which is particularly useful when intentionally limiting depth-of-field to improve portraits by blurring the area behind the main subject. Structurally, the optical formula includes 16 elements in 12 groups. It was created in pursuit of superior optical performance, utilizing an effective allocation of two GM (Glass Molded Aspherical) lens elements and one aspherical hybrid lens element. The optical design ensures high resolution and high contrast not just in the center of the frame but also in corners and at the edges. Focal length of 17-70mm for shooting in a broad range of situations This versatile zoom lens lets you enjoy shooting in a multitude of genres, from wide-angle scenes to telephoto moments. With a focal length range of 17mm to 70mm (a full-frame equivalent of 25.5-105mm), this large aperture F2.8 standard zoom lens for APS-C mirrorless cameras achieves a 4.1x zoom ratio. Its ideal for a variety of scenarios, from portraits and street snapshots, to landscapes and even close-ups The new 17-70mm F2.8 is Tamron's first high-speed zoom lens for mirrorless cameras with APS-C size sensors and is the world's first high-speed standard zoom lens for APS-C cameras with the focal length range of 17-70mm 4.1x zoom ratio. It features a maximum aperture of F2.8 across the entire 4.1x zoom ratio covering a focal length of 17-70mm (a full-frame equivalent of 25.5-105mm) ideal for everyday use, and superb optical performance. It is a small, lightweight lens that is also equipped with Tamron's VC (Vibration Compensation) mechanism to minimize camera shake. When shooting video, by leveraging AI technology, image stabilization performance improves compared to conventional models. The lens features Moisture-Resistant Construction, Fluorine Coating and a 67mm filter size  the same as the Tamron series of lenses for full-frame mirrorless cameras. Compatible with many of the features that Sony builds into its cameras, including Fast Hybrid AF and Eye AF, the lens is the ideal everyday zoom lens for a multitude of situations. It is a highly practical lens that enables photographers to attain high image quality while enjoying the benefits of the large F2.8 aperture.",

This 85mm F1.4 portrait lens renders infocus areas with unequalled resolution while the background dissolves into the smoothest, lushest bokeh imaginable. All of this is by design, supported by manufacturing and testing technology that only Sony can provide, for new dimensions of photographic and cinematographic expression. Features Designed to achieve 50 line pairs/mm resolving power Previously unattainable surface precision Constant F1.4 max aperture maintains exposure and depth of field Features 11-blade circular aperture contributes to gorgeous bokeh SSM (Super Sonic Wave Motor) for fast, quiet and precise focusing Nano AR Coating Features Dust and moisture resistant for robust reliability ED and Super ED glass reduces flare and ghosting Advanced simulation techniques control bokeh right from design Features Instant auto/manual focus selection Legal and Footnotes Designed to achieve 50 line pairs/mm resolving power It is not easy to achieve spatial frequency of 50 lines pairs per millimeter at a lens's widest aperture, but that is Sony's baseline for G Master design. Unprecedented resolution and other demanding design parameters yield outstanding reproduction of the most detailed subjects and scenes with superior contrast throughout every frame. G Master resolution is simply the highest in its class. Previously unattainable surface precision Built with three aspherical elements including a newly developed and essential ingredient for astonishing resolution  is a new XA (extreme aspherical) lens element with better that 0.01micron surface precision. The extremely precise XA element reduces aberration and delivers the ultimate resolution throughout the entire zoom range and aperture range, as well as from corner to corner of all image files. Constant F1.4 max aperture maintains exposure and depth of field Constant F1.4 max aperture maintains exposure and depth of field regardless of the focal range you choose to zoom to. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the areas out of the focal plane appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. 11blade circular aperture contributes to gorgeous bokeh Complementing the performance of the XA element are the first 11blade circular aperture ever implemented in an a lens, and exacting spherical aberration adjustment for each individual lens. The result is enchantingly softedged bokeh that is a hallmark of the Sony G Master series. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred.

Renowned Carl Zeiss contrast and resolution brings out the best in 7 series full frame E-mount bodies. The T* coating works with an innovative optical design to suppress internal reflections, for sublime contrast from highlights to deep blacks. In keeping with the Sonnar concept, a large F1.8 maximum aperture can produce beautiful full-frame background bokeh, but you also have the option of stopping down for extended depth-of-field. A bright lens like this is also an advantage when shooting indoors or outdoors in low light. Linear motor driven internal focusing is smooth and quiet, and a dust and moisture resistant design ensures consistently reliable performance. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2014 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

In keeping with the Sonnar concept, a large F1.8 maximum aperture can produce beautiful full-frame background bokeh, but you also have the option of stopping down for extended depth-of-field. A bright lens like this is also an advantage when shooting indoors or outdoors in low light. Linear motor driven internal focusing is smooth and quiet, and a dust and moisture resistant design ensures consistently reliable performance.        Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.    Carl Zeiss T* (T-star) coating  Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality.     Additional Features   Internal focusing  Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter.      2014 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

From the Manufacturer FE 90mm F2.8 Macro G OSS Full-frame E-mount Macro Lens The full-frame 90mm medium telephoto macro E-mount lens features built in image stabilization for sharp, clear images at up to 1:1 magnification, even when shooting handheld. Advanced optics and coatings with a 9-blade circular aperture deliver exceptionally smooth bokeh that G Lenses are renowned for.

Other advanced technologies, such as the Nano AR Coating and Super ED (extra-low dispersion) glass, elevate overall performance to an extremely high standard. Additional Features Nano AR Coating Effectively suppress reflections that can cause flare and ghosting with Sonys original Nano AR Coating technology. This precisely defined regular nano-structure allows accurate light transmission, contributing to high-quality images, even more so than lenses with coatings that use an irregular nano-structure. The reflection suppression characteristic of the Nano AR Coating is superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings, providing a notable improvement in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality. Circular Aperture When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens elements Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Internal focusing Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. Focus hold button Once youve adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the cameras custom settings. Focus range limiter This function allows you to set a limit on the focusing range which can save you time during AF operation as the lens will not hunt through the entire focusing range. In macro lenses, this limit can be on either the near or far range (as pictured). In the SEL90M28G, the limit is set on far ranges only. Sliding Focus Ring The focus ring slides back and forth to select manual or auto focus which together with a focus hold button, inner focus, and a focus range limiter provide optimum control for macro photography making it easier to shoot insects and other subjects that cannot be approached too closely. Minimal focus breathing and quiet operation are also advantageous for shooting movies. Lens-based optical image stabilization Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Direct Drive SSM (DDSSM) for quiet, precise focusing Quiet, precise DDSSM (Direct Drive SSM) focus drive - employs piezoelectric elements oscillating at ultrasonic frequencies to drive the focus lens groups. In this case two floating focus groups are driven by independent DDSSM systems for precision positioning of the relatively heavy lenses required for macro photography. The DDSSM drive system is remarkably quiet, making it ideal for animal and insect photography, as well as for movies. It also improves the precision of focus wobble employed to achieve optimum focus when shooting movies. 2015 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

Features 35 millimeters equivalent focal length (APS-C) is approximately 75 millimeters From the Manufacturer    E 50mm F1.8 OSS Prime Lens  This 50mm mid range telephoto lens offers a focal length that is perfect for portraiture and a range of other subjects, a bright F1.8 maximum aperture, Optical SteadyShot (OSS) image stabilization and impressive image quality, all in a surprisingly compact and lightweight package. Add responsive, quiet autofocus and aperture operation, and you have a lens that is ideally suited to shooting movies as well as stills.       Technology          Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    Lens-based optical image stabilization  Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.

For mid- to high-level users who seek a wider minimum focal length than offered by standard wideangle zoom lenses, the SEL-1018 is the ideal choice. NOTE:\"35 mm equivalent focal length (APS-C)\" and \"Angle of View (APS-C)\" are with interchangeable lens digital camera incorporating APS-C type image sensors. This super wide-angle zoom lens is perfect for taking photos of sweeping landscapes and producing striking images with emphasized perspective. Features incluse a constant maximum aperture of F4 and built-in Optical SteadyShot (OSS) image stabilization. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. The distance encoder plays an integral part in ADI flash metering, which delivers high precision flash metering that is unaffected by the reflectance of subjects or backgrounds. The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.

Minimum focus distance:11.5 m (AF)/11.35 m (MF) (3.284.93 ft [AF]/3.284.43 ft [MF]), Maximum Magnification ratio : 0.13x, Focal-Length : 70200 mm SEL70200G Product Description Sony SEL70200G 70-200mm Interchangeable Lens for Sony Alpha Cameras. Angle of View 34-12 30' The small size, versatile 35mm focal length, and outstanding overall performance of this Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* lens make it an ideal match for compact 35mm full frame format E-mount bodies. Although the optical design is state-of-the-art, this superb wide angle lens remains true to the original Sonnar concept with a bright F2.8 maximum aperture (Sonne means sun in German). Three double-sided aspherical elements minimize aberration so that stunning contrast and resolution are maintained right out to the image edges at all apertures. The renowned T* lens coating contributes to natural color reproduction as well. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Effectively suppress reflections that can cause flare and ghosting with Sonys original Nano AR Coating technology. This precisely defined regular nano-structure allows accurate light transmission, contributing to high-quality images, even more so than lenses with coatings that use an irregular nano-structure. The reflection suppression characteristic of the Nano AR Coating is superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings, providing a notable improvement in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Once youve adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the cameras custom settings. This function allows you to set a limit on the focusing range which can save you time during AF operation as the lens will not hunt through the entire focusing range. In macro lenses, this limit can be on either the near or far range (as pictured). In the SAL70200G, the limit is set on far ranges only. In the SAL300F28G, focusing can be limited either to a far range or to a range that you specify yourself. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. Aluminum alloy is used in the construction of the G Lenses and other high-end lenses to ensure high optical performance. This material is lightweight, durable, and highly resistant to the effects of temperature change. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. The dust and moisture resistance design makes this lens appropriate for heavy-duty outdoor use, especially when combined with a camera that employs weather resistant measures. 2014 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

From the Manufacturer    FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS Full-frame E-mount Zoom Lens  The small size, versatile 35mm focal length, and outstanding overall performance of this Carl Zeiss Sonnar T* lens make it an ideal match for compact 35mm full frame format E-mount bodies. Although the optical design is state-of-the-art, this superb wide angle lens remains true to the original Sonnar concept with a bright F2.8 maximum aperture (Sonne means sun in German). Three double-sided aspherical elements minimize aberration so that stunning contrast and resolution are maintained right out to the image edges at all apertures. The renowned T* lens coating contributes to natural color reproduction as well.        Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    Nano AR Coating  Effectively suppress reflections that can cause flare and ghosting with Sonys original Nano AR Coating technology. This precisely defined regular nano-structure allows accurate light transmission, contributing to high-quality images, even more so than lenses with coatings that use an irregular nano-structure. The reflection suppression characteristic of the Nano AR Coating is superior to conventional anti-reflective coatings, providing a notable improvement in clarity, contrast, and overall image quality.    ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass  As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.                Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.    Focus hold button  Once youve adjusted focus to where you want it, pressing this button on the lens barrel will keep the lens locked to that focusing distance. The preview function can also be assigned to this button through the cameras custom settings.    Focus range limiter  This function allows you to set a limit on the focusing range which can save you time during AF operation as the lens will not hunt through the entire focusing range. In macro lenses, this limit can be on either the near or far range (as pictured). In the SAL70200G, the limit is set on far ranges only. In the SAL300F28G, focusing can be limited either to a far range or to a range that you specify yourself.     Additional Features   Internal focusing  Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter.    Aluminum alloy lens barrel  Aluminum alloy is used in the construction of the G Lenses and other high-end lenses to ensure high optical performance. This material is lightweight, durable, and highly resistant to the effects of temperature change.    Lens-based optical image stabilization  Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   VERSATILE FULL-FRAME LENS: The powerful lens for the mirrorless full-frame system of Sony fulfills the highest requirements. Despite its compact design, the image meets the expectations of professional photographers. EXCELLENT RESOLUTION AND HIGH CONTRAST: Richly saturated and vivid colours are a must in the creation of lasting impressions. However, stray light within an optical system leads to a lightening of the image that is particularly noticeable in the shadows. This reduces image contrast, with the result that exposures lack contrast and appear faded. To avoid this, ZEISS combines various specially developed technologies to reduce the undesirable effects of stray light. ROBUST AND WEATHERPROOF METAL CONSTRUCTION: Thanks to features that are designed to keep out dust and spray water, the lens is perfectly suited for critical outdoor conditions. It is also designed for many years of intensive use. INNOVATIVE OLED DISPLAY: For the first time, you can accurately read the focus distance and depth of field simply and intuitively on the OLED display on the lens. Especially in poor light conditions - excellent readability is always guaranteed. SMOOTH AND RELIABLE AUTOFOCUS: The design of the autofocus system requires an extremely accurate shifting of particular lens groups. The focusing system of ZEISS lenses is designed to ensure a robust and smooth-running autofocus mechanism with the best imaging performance. The telephoto lens for a new era The ZEISS Batis 1.8/85 lens has a fast maximum aperture of f/1.8 for creatively blurred backgrounds together with built-in optical image stabilisation so you can keep moving and keep shooting hand-held even in very low lighting conditions. The focal length is ideal for portrait, event, and wedding photography. Our newest innovation is the OLED display, giving you an instant reading of the current depth of field and distance to your point of focus. It is a powerful companion to your Sony mirrorless camera, delivering high-performance professional-quality results. Taking advantage of the exciting possibilities of Sony mirrorless cameras, ZEISS Batis lenses are designed specifically to unleash the creative potential of full-frame sensors. If you are looking for E-mount lenses to give perfect image quality and which are robust enough to resist dust and spray water and offer not only super-fast, but quiet autofocus, then these lenses will deliver.",

        "description": "Incredibly compact and light weight Superb Image Quality High MTF performance Close focus with 1:2 Macro Moisture_Resistant Construction Every day, every subject  take a wider look at the world Get closer to your subject. As close as 0.15m. One of the key features that makes this lens so exciting is its amazing ability to shoot close-ups. With this lens, you can get closer to an object than youd ever imagined. At the 0.15m (5.9 in) MOD (Minimum Object Distance), the lens achieves its maximum magnification ratio of 1:2. Youll never again be frustrated because you cannot get close to an object while shooting. This remarkable performance allows users to create compositions that exploit dramatic perspective (closer subjects are larger, and distant ones are smaller) and that are unique to wide-angle lenses. By getting close to an object, you can produce a one-of-a-kind photo and leverage the beautifully blurred background bokeh. The 35mm F/2.8 Di III OSD M1:2 (Model F053) is a wide-angle, fixed focal lens suitable for just about every shooting situation. The 35mm focal length is wide angle-of-view, but natural perspective and field-of-view for instinctive image capture. The lens is great for many different types of photography, including portraits with context, food photography, and nature. Very light in weight and compact, it hardly adds anything to the heft to your bag, so you can carry it comfortably every day. Focusing as close as 0.15m (5.9 in), you can fill the frame with even small subjects. In addition to the F/2.8 aperture, the Model F053 is constructed using special glass materials including LD (Low Dispersion) and GM (Glass Molded Aspherical) lens elements effectively arranged to quash aberrations. The Model F053 provides outstanding optical performance across the entire frame, and delivers a sharp image, right down to the texture of the subject. With Moisture-Resistant Construction and dirt-resistant Fluorine Coating, photographers can shoot confidently outdoors. You will discover beauty that you have never experienced before. This lens may lead you to new discoveries.",

A perfect match for 7 series, 35mm full-frame E-mount cameras, Outstanding optical performance in a versatile 35mm focal length, ZEISS quality delivers superior contrast and resolution throughout the image Filter diameter (mm): 72 mm.Minimum Focus Distance : 098 ft (03 m), Maximum Magnification ratio : 018x, Focal-Length : 138 in Bright F14 maximum aperture, Aperture ring designed for still or movie shooting, Corner to corner sharpness w/Advanced Spherical elements;High reliability in harsh conditions Dust and moisture resistant design, 9-blade circular aperture contributes to gorgeous bokeh, Direct Drive SSM (DDSSM) for quiet, precise focusing Product Description The 35mm focal length makes the Distagon T FE 35mm F1.4 ZA an excellent choice for a wide range of photography, from snapshots and landscapes to indoor portraits and night scenes-producing beautiful bokeh through its bright 9-blade F1.4 aperture. The advanced optical design-including a spherical and AA (advanced spherical) lens elements combined with renowned ZEISS T coating-deliver outstanding image resolution and suppresses reflections for superior contrast clarity. ZEISS T anti-reflective coating minimises flare From the Manufacturer Distagon T* FE 35mm F1.4 ZA Full-frame E-mount Prime Lens The 35mm focal length makes the Distagon T* FE 35mm F1.4 ZA an excellent choice for a wide range of photography, from snapshots and landscapes to indoor portraits and night scenes  producing beautiful bokeh through its bright 9- blade F1.4 aperture. The advanced optical design - including aspherical and AA (advanced spherical) lens elements combined with renowned ZEISS T* coating - deliver outstanding image resolution and suppresses reflections for superior contrast clarity. Additional Features Unmatched ZEISS T* (T-star) coating Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the ZEISS T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality. Circular Aperture When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens elements Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Responsive aperture ring A responsive aperture ring offers positive action that will satisfy professional photographers and moviemakers alike. The aperture ring click stops can be switched on or off as required. Off is the preferred setting for moviemaking since it results in the least aperture operation noise. When On the ring provides tactile feedback that is useful when shooting stills. 2015 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

In 35mm full-frame format terms the 11x zoom range of this lens goes from 27mm wide to 300mm telephoto, with superb image quality all the way thanks to an advanced optical design and Optical SteadyShot image stabilization. Thats heavyweight performance in the lightest and most compact 18-200 mm zoom in the E-mount lineup. The perfect travel lens. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2012 Sony Electronics, All rights reserved.

Angle of View (APS-C) -70. Maximum aperture (F) - 2.8. 35 mm equivalent focal length (APS-C) - 11.82 inch Broaden your view with a wide angle: From a vast cliff to a stretching sandy beach, fit everything in with a 20 mm wide angle. Angle of View (APS-C): 70 Product Description 20mm F2.8 Prime Lens Not only will the 20mm (30mm in 35mm full-frame format) focal length and F2.8 maximum aperture appeal to experienced photographers, but the outstanding resolution of this lens will satisfy their most stringent image quality requirements as well. Three aspheric elements help to achieve superb contrast and resolution right out to the image edges, while simultaneously enabling a compact 20.4 mm-thick pancake design that makes for a portable combination with compact E-mount cameras. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Only the rear groups of the optical system move to focus the lens, which allows for speedy AF operation and a shorter minimum focusing distance. Since the front of the lens does not rotate, operability is improved when shooting with a polarizing filter attached. 2013 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

        "description": "For Sony E-Mount interchangeable Lens cameras and full frame compatible Aperture range of F1.8-22; constructed of 10 elements in 8 groups Ultra compact size with a maximum diameter of 2.56 inches and a minimum focusing distance of 11.4 inches Uses 58mm size Filters and features 9 diaphragm blades. Minimum Focusing Distance: 11.4in (0.29m). Aluminum alloy housing is both lightweight and durable. The integrated autofocus motor works in conjunction with Sony cameras' focusing systems for quick, accurate, and precise AF control. Manual focus override is also available for refining your focus position. Rokinons AF 35mm F1.8 compact and rugged build quality is paired with a sophisticated optical design to provide superb performance and versatility. Incorporating 4 special elements (2 Aspherical and 2 High Refractive Index) plus Ultra MultiCoating, it achieves rich, high resolution image quality from the center to the edges of the frame, even at F/1.8 full aperture. Its also a capable, high precision performer as a standard / normal focal length equivalent to 52.5mm with Sony E mount APS-C sensor models. Designed for exceptional sharpness at maximum F1.8 aperture, this lens excels at available light photography and at creating content with a shallow depth of eld. Thanks to its 9-blade circular aperture, pleasing bokeh eects that exhibit natural, circular, out-of-focus highlights are achieved at a level that will satisfy both professional and amateur photographers. The AF motor system employs a Stepping Motor (STM) that is optimized for both phase detection AF and contrast AF. It provides a smooth and almost eortless shooting experience, and the Internal Focus (IF) design allows for quick and precise autofocus performance with silent focusing while recording video. Notable features include weather sealing that helps protect against dust and moisture, and a Custom Switch that enables the focusing ring to function either as a manual focus control (Mode 1) or as an aperture control (Mode 2). Additional Custom Switch functions are being developed and made available via rmware updates. Fine tuning focusing parameters and other updates for the AF 35mm F1.8 and other AF ROKINON Sony E mount lenses are obtained by using a ROKINON Lens Station.",

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Lens not Zoomable Exceptionally portable and versatile for everyday use Minimum working distance of only 9.75cm with 1:1 magnification Simple, compact 6-group 7-element lens Internal stepping motor and Rear-focusing design for video capture Product Description Sony SEL30M35 Digital SLR Camera Lens (Black) From the Manufacturer    E 35mm F1.8 OSS Prime Lens  High performance and a compact design make the SEL-35F18 an ideal second lens that is easy to carry around when capturing the action. Its ideal for a wide variety of photos, including snapshots while strolling, night shots (thanks to the bright maximum aperture) and portraits with superb background/foreground blur.       Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass  As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.    Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.         Lens-based optical image stabilization  Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.    Additional Features   Internal focusing  Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter.     2012 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

Minimum Focusing Distance: 11.4in (0.29m). Aluminum alloy housing is both lightweight and durable. The integrated autofocus motor works in conjunction with Sony cameras' focusing systems for quick, accurate, and precise AF control. Manual focus override is also available for refining your focus position. Samyangs AF 35mm F1.8 compact and rugged build quality is paired with a sophisticated optical design to provide superb performance and versatility. Incorporating 4 special elements (2 Aspherical and 2 High Refractive Index) plus Ultra MultiCoating, it achieves rich, high resolution image quality from the center to the edges of the frame, even at F/1.8 full aperture. Its also a capable, high precision performer as a standard / normal focal length equivalent to 52.5mm with Sony E mount APS-C sensor models. Designed for exceptional sharpness at maximum F1.8 aperture, this lens excels at available light photography and at creating content with a shallow depth of eld. Thanks to its 9-blade circular aperture, pleasing bokeh eects that exhibit natural, circular, out-of-focus highlights are achieved at a level that will satisfy both professional and amateur photographers. The AF motor system employs a Stepping Motor (STM) that is optimized for both phase detection AF and contrast AF. It provides a smooth and almost eortless shooting experience, and the Internal Focus (IF) design allows for quick and precise autofocus performance with silent focusing while recording video. Notable features include weather sealing that helps protect against dust and moisture, and a Custom Switch that enables the focusing ring to function either as a manual focus control (Mode 1) or as an aperture control (Mode 2). Additional Custom Switch functions are being developed and made available via rmware updates. Fine tuning focusing parameters and other updates for the AF 35mm F1.8 and other AF Samyang Sony E mount lenses are obtained by using a Samyang Lens Station.",

From the Manufacturer FE 28mm F2 E-mount Prime Lens An excellent choice as a second lens, this full-frame 28mm wide-angle prime features a bright F2 maximum aperture and outstanding overall optical performance. Advanced optics and coatings with a 9-blade circular aperture deliver beautiful images. Internal focusing on a fast and quite linear actuator makes this lens ideal for both still and movie. Additional Features Circular Aperture When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass / Super ED glass As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens elements Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Internal focusing Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. Go even wider or fisheye with converters For even wider perspectives an optional Ultra-wide Converter (SEL075UWC) and Fisheye Converter (SEL057FEC) can be added to increase the angle of view to 21mm wide-angle or 16mm fisheye with full 180 coverage, respectively. Corresponding EXIF data is generated when these converters are attached to the lens, making data management easy. 1 1 See SEL075UWC/SEL057FEC Product Information for further details. 2015 Sony Electronics Inc.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Stepper motor ensures progressive and quiet autofocus. Water and dust proof design A large lens hood as standard to eliminate side spokes. Designed to minimize flare and ghost images. \"Made in Japan\" with incredible craftsmanship. Captured with the SIGMA 56mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary lens in EF-M mount by Filly Bonito-Brook Offering an opportunity to experience the fun of shooting wide open, with F1.4 brightness The first of the series is the standard lens 30mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary, and the second is the wide-angle lens 16mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary. The third addition is this smallest mid-tele lens in its class, 56mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary. While retaining the compact, lightweight, and outstanding image quality concepts of the Contemporary line, thanks to SIGMAs leading-edge technology, this lens provides the amount of bokeh and admirable brightness expected from F1.4 lenses even in the mid-tele range. This addition completes the large aperture series comprised of portable wide-angle, standard, and telephoto lenses. Diffraction MTF There are two types of MTF chart. One considers the diffraction quality of light, which is called Diffraction MTF, and the other, Geometrical MTF does not. The quality of light appears in the diffracted light, and becomes more distinct as the F value gets bigger, resulting in lower image quality. Also, diffracted light exists at every aperture, which is why SIGMA has been releasing Diffraction MTF data from the beginning since it is very close to the actual image data. The readings at 10 lines per millimeter measure the lenss contrast ability (red lines), repeating fine parallel lines spaced at 30 lines per millimeter measure the lenss sharpness ability (green lines), when the aperture is wide open. Geometrical MTF The advantage of using Geometric MTF data is that it is easy to measure and calculate since it does not consider the diffraction quality of light, yet it tends to show higher values in the graph than actual images. The readings at 10 lines per millimeter measure the lenss contrast ability (red lines), repeating fine parallel lines spaced at 30 lines per millimeter measure the lenss sharpness ability (green lines), when the aperture is wide open. Supplied Accessories LENS HOOD LH582-01* FRONT CAP LCF  55mm REAR CAP LCR  *The lens hood cuts harmful rays that can negatively affect photographs while also minimizing reflectivity within the hood itself. The hood also features a rubber construction and a non-slip groove to make it easy to hold in a variety of shooting situations. Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer Bright prime functionality to experience photography at its best Developed to feature a lightweight, compact package for everyday use, SIGMA DN lenses for mirrorless cameras deliver superior performance covering the key focal lengths. The new lens builds on the success of the 30mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary, which SIGMA released in 2016 as the first in a new series of prime lenses for mirrorless cameras. The 56mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary also combines F1.4 brightness with top-level optical performance. Designed to minimize flare and ghosting with a rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. From an early stage in the lens design process, flare and ghosting have been measured to establish an optical design resistant to strong incident light sources such as backlighting. SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting to help photographers produce sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions. The included lens hood can be attached to block out extraneous light, which can have a negative effect on rendering performance. Outstanding optical performance and build quality The SIGMA 56mm F1.4 DC DN | Contemporary features SIGMAs inner focus technologies, while lighter lens elements in the focus lens group make possible a more compact actuator. Moreover, this lens offers outstanding stability whether the photographer is shooting handheld or has the camera placed on a surface. Structurally, the lens features materials and parts that contribute to its compact, lightweight structure. In summary, this is an unprecedented lens that combines outstanding optical performance with exceptional portability and usability. The mount features a special sealing to make the lens an excellent choice in a wide variety of conditions. High-precision, rugged brass bayonet mount The brass mount combines high precision with rugged construction. Its treated surfaces and enhanced strength contribute to the exceptional durability of the lens.   Capture fine detail   Smooth bokeh and minimised flare.

Large aperature wide-angle lens offering the best optical preformance in its category FLD, SLD and Aspherical lens elements.Filter Size (mm)-77 Super Multi-Layer lens coating reduces flare and ghosting. Minimum focusing distance - 25 cm / 9.8 inch Angle of View (35mm) : 84.1. Includes fast and near silent HSM autofocus, Compatible with Sigma USB Dock In order to avoid any malfunction problem, please operate one USB Dock per computer The large-diameter wide-angArt line delivers high-level artistic expressionle lens that reveals a new horizon of image quality. An all-new Art line lens featuring F1.4 brightness. Outstanding optical performance ideal for nightscapes and cityscapes. SIGMA has a proven reputation for wide-angle lens design and manufacturing. Drawing on this experience and design know-how, refined through development of the SIGMA 35mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art and 50mm F1.4 DG HSM | Art in our Art line, we have successfully minimized sagittal coma flare, chromatic aberration, distortion, and vignetting to achieve exceptional levels of optical performance with almost no aberration or distortion. This lens provides the best possible performance when photographing a variety of subjects from cityscapes, mountain ranges, and the star-filled night sky to indoor photography with low illumination or scenes that require a smooth bokeh effect. Enjoy the astonishing optical performance of the new F1.4 series that has just joined SIGMAs iconic Art line. SIGMA expertise and leading- edge manufacturing technologies deliver breathtaking optical performance. Brass made bayonet mount This lens incorporates a brass made bayonet mount which has both high accuracy and durability. A special treatment to reinforce its strength is applied to the surface giving it greater strength and making it highly resistant to long-term use. High resolution with beautiful bokeh effects While maximizing resolution at the area in focus, this lens offers a silky-smooth bokeh affect to the front and rear. To achieve exceptionally crisp resolution, we have minimized sagittal coma flare, chromatic aberration, and every other type of optical aberration that affects image quality. The result is minute detail without bleeding or streaking, even at wide-open aperture. Moreover, we have also minimized both vignetting and color streaking to the front and rear of the area in focus, thereby establishing a bokeh effect that is natural and aesthetically pleasing. Smooth bokeh and minimised flare. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. From an early stage in the lens design process, flare and ghosting have been measured to establish an optical design resistant to strong incident light sources such as backlighting. SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting to help photographers produce sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions. The included lens hood can be attached to block out extraneous light, which can have a negative effect on rendering performance. Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer. HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) HSM (Hyper Sonic Motor) delivers high AF speed and extremely quiet performance. SIGMAs latest AF algorithm makes possible even smoother automatic focusing. After AF has done its job, fulltime MF (manual focus) allows you to make fine adjustments to focus simply by turning the focus ring. Using the SIGMA USB DOCK (sold separately) allows you to access the MO (manual override) function, which allows you to manually focus at any time during AF by turning the focus ring. Compatible with full-frame Sony E-mount cameras The version of this lens compatible with Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras contains the same optical system as for SLRs. SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11 is not required, as the lens performs the same functions as the converter, including in-camera image stabilization and in-camera lens aberration correction. In addition, the lens is compatible with Sonys Continuous AF, which is not addressed by MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11. SIGMA plans to offer over time Sony E-mount versions of every full-frame prime lens currently available in the Art line, from 14mm to 135mm.Note: This product is developed, manufactured and sold based on the specifications of E-mount which was disclosed by Sony Corporation under the license agreement with Sony Supplied Accessories Padded Case LENS HOOD LH830-03 FRONT CAP LCF  77mm REAR CAP LCR  *The lens hood cuts harmful rays that can negatively affect photographs while also minimizing reflectivity within the hood itself. The hood also features a rubber construction and a non-slip groove to make it easy to hold in a variety of shooting situations. SIGMA WR CERAMIC PROTECTOR 77mm (OPTIONAL) With many applications in aerospace and other industries, glass ceramic is an extremely tough type of crystallized glass that serves as the foundation for Clear Glass Ceramic. While featuring the high transmittance required of optical devices, this advanced new material combines greater hardness than chemically strengthened glass and greater flexibility than sapphire crystal glass. These qualities make Clear Glass Ceramic the ideal material for protective lens filters.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Large diameter delivering f/1.8 brightness Beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light streaking Ultra-wide Angle of view Super multi-layer coating helps reduce flare and ghosting Large HSM (hyper-sonic motor) delivers ample torque to the focusing group for outstanding speed, ensuring exceptionally stable performance even at lower speeds 14mm ultra-wide-angle and F1.8 brightness: a new dimension of visual experience A true high-speed lens that delivers a new dimension of visual experience In taking photographs of starry skies or other celestial scenes at night, or of the seashore with a wide perspective, a large-diameter lens is a strong ally, since it allows the capture of a moving subject by adjusting shutter speed without relying on ISO sensitivity. With its full-frame 35mm coverage, 14mm focal length for an ultra-wide angle of view, F2 barrier-breaking F1.8, the SIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art is the true high-speed ultra-wide-angle lens for which so many photographers have been waiting. Although some zoom lenses are available that can cover 14mm, the large diameter delivering F1.8 brightness is a singular advantage. Going beyond fast shutter speed, this lens can capture a swarm of fireflies with crystal clarity, a beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light streaking. A mode of expression that was unavailableuntil now By leveraging its extreme angle of view and the dramatic perspective this creates, an ultra-wide-angle lens can get up close and personal with a subject while at the same time taking in a vast backgroundan example of photography going beyond normal human vision. SIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art combines the extremely deep depth of field that comes from an ultra-wide angle of view with the extremely shallow depth of field that comes from F1.8 brightness. The result is a sharply captured subject set against a vast background dramatically blurred with a beautiful bokeh effect. Its a highly impressive mode of photographic expression that until now simply hasnt existed. Featuring a large-diameter aspherical lens element The SIGMA 12-24mmF4 DG HSM | Art was the first SIGMA lens to feature a large 80mm aspherical lens element. Building on the expertise derived from this success, the new lens features a large 80mm precision-molded glass aspherical lens as its front element. This technology has made possible the 14mm F1.8 specificationthe first of its kind. Minimized chromatic aberrations Three FLD (F Low Dispersion) glass elements and four SLD (Super Low Dispersion) glass elements help minimize transverse chromatic aberration, which tends to be noticeable in shots taken with ultra-wide-angle lenses. Offering excellent peripheral brightness, this lens delivers outstanding image quality from the center to the edges Minimized distortion Serving as the front lens element, the large 80mm precision-molded glass aspherical lens effectively minimizes distortion. Offering excellent peripheral brightness, this lens delivers outstanding image quality from the center to the edges. Distinctive bokeh effect Even at the 14mm ultra-wide-angle of view, F1.8 brightness makes possible a very shallow depth of field with the subject standing out dramatically against a bokeh background. Its the unique mode of expression that only a large-diameter lens can deliver. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. Designed to minimize flare and ghosting From the start of the design process, SIGMA measured flare and ghosting to establish an optical design that is resistant to strong incidental light sources such as backlight. At the prototyping stage, SIGMA used not only simulations but actual photographic experiments to assess flare and ghosting under multiple criteria, identify the causes of these issues under a wide range of situations, and take measures to mitigate them. In addition, SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating helps further reduce flare and ghosting and provide sharp, high-contrast images even in backlit conditions. Supplied Accessories COVER LENS CAP LC954-01 REAR CAP LCR  SOFT PADDED CASE REAR FILTER HOLDER FHR-11 (Optional) The Rear Filter Holder FHR-11 is an accessory that enables photographers to use a filter sheet with the lens. By attaching it to the rear of the lens, it will allow more freedom of expression. * Only available for the Canon mount lens. There are no plans for the development in SIGMA and Nikon mounts Compatible with full-frame Sony E-mount cameras The version of this lens compatible with Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras contains the same optical system as for SLRs. SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11 is not required, as the lens performs the same functions as the converter, including in-camera image stabilization and in-camera lens aberration correction. In addition, the lens is compatible with Sonys Continuous AF, which is not addressed by MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11. SIGMA plans to offer over time Sony E-mount versions of every full-frame prime lens currently available in the Art line, from 14mm to 135mm.Note: This product is developed, manufactured and sold based on the specifications of E-mount which was disclosed by Sony Corporation under the license agreement with Sony Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer. Art line delivers high-level artistic expression Photographer David ODwyer, DOD Media Inc.  Specification       Lens construction    16 elements in 11 groups      Minimum aperture    F16      Angle of view (35mm)    114.2      Number of diaphragm blades    9 (Rounded diaphragm)      Maximum magnification ratio    19.8       Specification The Sigma 14mm f/1.8 DG HSM Art Lens for Canon EF is the world's first 1.8 prime lens at the 14mm focal length. This fast wide prime features the same large aspherical element touted in the Sigma 12-24mm F4 art to control distortion and create stunning imagery. An updated hyper sonic motor (HSM) provides fast and accurate autofocus while 3 Premium FLD and 4 sold glass elements control chromatic aberration and sagittal Comma flare. Building on the highly reputable art line, The Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is designed to resolve the latest high Megapixel DSLR sensors. Like Each and every global Vision lens, The Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is handcrafted at our single factory in aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigma facility. Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept hyper sonic motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time Just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.6\". The lens barrel is constructed using a thermally stable composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from Brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB dock for FINE-TUNED control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.With its full-frame 35mm coverage, 14mm focal length for an ultra-wide Angle of view, F2 barrier-breaking F1.8, The Sigma 14mm F1.8 DG HSM Art is the true high-speed ultra-wide-angle lens for which so many photographers have been waiting. Although some zoom lenses are available that can cover 14mm, the large diameter delivering F1.8 brightness is a singular advantage. Going beyond fast shutter speed, this lens can capture a swarm of fireflies with crystal clarity, a beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light",

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Outstanding performance in an affordable full-frame zoom that is lightweight and compact Maximum magnification ratio (x): 0.19x.Three a spherical elements and one ED glass element contribute to beautiful rendering with minimum aberration Built-in Optical Steady Shot image stabilization ensures clearer, sharper handheld shots;Aperture Blades : 7 Product Description This affordable high-performance zoom lens is not only compact and lightweight, but it has been specifically designed to bring out the best in the a7-series full-frame E-mount bodies as well. The zoom range extends from 28mm through 70mm, providing easy access to the most frequently used angles of view, and thanks to an advanced optical design the change in overall lens length during zooming is minimal From the Manufacturer    FE 28-70mm F3.5-5.6 OSS Full-frame Zoom Lens  This affordable mid-range zoom lens for 35mm full frame format cameras combines high optical performance with compact, lightweight convenience. The FE 28-70mm is ideal for a wide range of subjects, and is dust and moisture resistant for consistent reliability. Optical SteadyShot image stabilization included.       Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    ED (Extra-low Dispersion) glass  As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration.    Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.         Lens-based optical image stabilization  Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.    Additional Features   Internal focusing  Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter.     2013 Sony Electronics Inc. All rights reserved.

The distance encoder is a lens component that directly detects the position of the focusing mechanism, and sends a signal to the CPU in order to measure distance to the subject. During flash photography, this data is very useful in calculating how much flash output is appropriate to the scene. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2012 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

From the Manufacturer    E 16mm F2.8 Wide Angle Lens  Landscapes, architecture, snapshots  this 24 mm equivalent (35mm full frame format) E-mount prime lens can cover them all. Compact and extremely lightweight, this lens will always be ready for action without being a burden to carry. While a refined aluminum alloy exterior gives the lens a sophisticated feel, a motor on the inside delivers smooth, quiet autofocus and aperture operation that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills.       Technology             Circular Aperture  When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result.    Aspherical lens elements  Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality.

Large diameter delivering f/1.8 brightness Beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light streaking Ultra-wide Angle of view Super multi-layer coating helps reduce flare and ghosting Large HSM (hyper-sonic motor) delivers ample torque to the focusing group for outstanding speed, ensuring exceptionally stable performance even at lower speeds 14mm ultra-wide-angle and F1.8 brightness: a new dimension of visual experience A true high-speed lens that delivers a new dimension of visual experience In taking photographs of starry skies or other celestial scenes at night, or of the seashore with a wide perspective, a large-diameter lens is a strong ally, since it allows the capture of a moving subject by adjusting shutter speed without relying on ISO sensitivity. With its full-frame 35mm coverage, 14mm focal length for an ultra-wide angle of view, F2 barrier-breaking F1.8, the SIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art is the true high-speed ultra-wide-angle lens for which so many photographers have been waiting. Although some zoom lenses are available that can cover 14mm, the large diameter delivering F1.8 brightness is a singular advantage. Going beyond fast shutter speed, this lens can capture a swarm of fireflies with crystal clarity, a beautiful bokeh effect, and outstanding control of light streaking. A mode of expression that was unavailableuntil now By leveraging its extreme angle of view and the dramatic perspective this creates, an ultra-wide-angle lens can get up close and personal with a subject while at the same time taking in a vast backgroundan example of photography going beyond normal human vision. SIGMA 14mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art combines the extremely deep depth of field that comes from an ultra-wide angle of view with the extremely shallow depth of field that comes from F1.8 brightness. The result is a sharply captured subject set against a vast background dramatically blurred with a beautiful bokeh effect. Its a highly impressive mode of photographic expression that until now simply hasnt existed. Featuring a large-diameter aspherical lens element The SIGMA 12-24mmF4 DG HSM | Art was the first SIGMA lens to feature a large 80mm aspherical lens element. Building on the expertise derived from this success, the new lens features a large 80mm precision-molded glass aspherical lens as its front element. This technology has made possible the 14mm F1.8 specificationthe first of its kind. Minimized chromatic aberrations Three FLD (F Low Dispersion) glass elements and four SLD (Super Low Dispersion) glass elements help minimize transverse chromatic aberration, which tends to be noticeable in shots taken with ultra-wide-angle lenses. Offering excellent peripheral brightness, this lens delivers outstanding image quality from the center to the edges Minimized distortion Serving as the front lens element, the large 80mm precision-molded glass aspherical lens effectively minimizes distortion. Offering excellent peripheral brightness, this lens delivers outstanding image quality from the center to the edges. Distinctive bokeh effect Even at the 14mm ultra-wide-angle of view, F1.8 brightness makes possible a very shallow depth of field with the subject standing out dramatically against a bokeh background. Its the unique mode of expression that only a large-diameter lens can deliver. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. Designed to minimize flare and ghosting From the start of the design process, SIGMA measured flare and ghosting to establish an optical design that is resistant to strong incidental light sources such as backlight. At the prototyping stage, SIGMA used not only simulations but actual photographic experiments to assess flare and ghosting under multiple criteria, identify the causes of these issues under a wide range of situations, and take measures to mitigate them. In addition, SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating helps further reduce flare and ghosting and provide sharp, high-contrast images even in backlit conditions. Supplied Accessories COVER LENS CAP LC954-01 REAR CAP LCR  SOFT PADDED CASE REAR FILTER HOLDER FHR-11 (Optional) The Rear Filter Holder FHR-11 is an accessory that enables photographers to use a filter sheet with the lens. By attaching it to the rear of the lens, it will allow more freedom of expression. * Only available for the Canon mount lens. There are no plans for the development in SIGMA and Nikon mounts Compatible with full-frame Sony E-mount cameras The version of this lens compatible with Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras contains the same optical system as for SLRs. SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11 is not required, as the lens performs the same functions as the converter, including in-camera image stabilization and in-camera lens aberration correction. In addition, the lens is compatible with Sonys Continuous AF, which is not addressed by MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11. SIGMA plans to offer over time Sony E-mount versions of every full-frame prime lens currently available in the Art line, from 14mm to 135mm.Note: This product is developed, manufactured and sold based on the specifications of E-mount which was disclosed by Sony Corporation under the license agreement with Sony Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer. Art line delivers high-level artistic expression Photographer David ODwyer, DOD Media Inc.

This fast wide prime features the same large aspherical element touted in the Sigma 12-24mm F4 art to control distortion and create stunning imagery. An updated hyper sonic motor (HSM) provides fast and accurate autofocus while 3 Premium FLD and 4 sold glass elements control chromatic aberration and sagittal Comma flare. Building on the highly reputable art line, The Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is designed to resolve the latest high Megapixel DSLR sensors. Like Each and every global Vision lens, The Sigma 14mm 1.8 DG HSM Art is handcrafted at our single factory in aizu, Japan and undergoes individual evaluation before leaving Sigma facility. Complementing the optical performance is an equally adept hyper sonic motor, which provides fast, smooth, and near-silent autofocus performance. This focusing motor also enables full-time manual focus override at any time Just by rotating the focus ring for refined manual control and focusing as close as 10.6\". The lens barrel is constructed using a thermally stable composite material, which supports working in a wide variety of temperatures and conditions, and the lens mount is constructed from Brass for long-term durability and mounting accuracy. Additionally, this lens is also compatible with the optional Sigma USB dock for FINE-TUNED control over focusing parameters and other lens characteristics.With its full-frame 35mm coverage, 14mm focal length for an ultra-wide Angle of view, F2 barrier-breaking F1.8, The Sigma 14mm F1.8 DG HSM Art is the true high-speed ultra-wide-angle lens for which so many photographers have been waiting.

This model combines refined G Lens bokeh with new levels of resolution in an outstanding constant F2.8 telephoto zoom that offers unsurpassed rendering, blazing AF, and extraordinary image stabilization performance. Fast AF Optimized For Stills And Video Two heavy focus groups are rapidly and precisely positioned by separate actuators: a powerful ring SSM (Super Sonic wave Motor) actuator for the front group, and a double linear motor actuator for the rear group. Improved positioning precision works with real-time feedback from multiple position sensors to allow the body's AF system to operate at full capacity. 11 Blades For Luscious Bokeh Sony's circular aperture design has traditionally employed up to 9 blades, but this lens incorporates an 11-blade circular aperture that takes bokeh quality to new levels of smooth beauty with natural looking highlights. Stabilized For Sharp, Blur-Free Images High-performance image stabilization is built right into the lens for sharp, blur-free images with a wide range of subjects. The heavy stabilization lens is driven by a linear motor for fast, precise stabilization. 5-axis image stabilization becomes available when used with ? series bodies that feature built-in image stabilization. Natural Images Without Spurious Color Chromatic aberration that can be a problem in telephoto lenses is thoroughly suppressed by the use of four ED (Extra-low-Dispersion) glass elements and two Super ED glass elements. Color bleeding is banished so the subject can be captured with maximum sharpness.",

Designed specifically for the unique rear element to sensor distance of Sony E mount cameras, and to deliver outstanding resolution, its optical configuration of 11 elements in 9 groups utilizes 2 Aspherical and 2 High-Refractive Index lens elements. Ultra Multi Coating is also used to minimize aberrations and unnecessary light dispersion. To enhance the exceptional optical technology of the Samyang 35mm F1.4 AF, a new, quiet, fast, and precise IF (Internal Focusing) autofocus system is employed for superior focus detection that will capture any moment clearly. The bright F1.4 maximum aperture takes the stress out of working in difficult lighting conditions, and provides shallow depth of field for greater point of focus control, while the circular 9-blade diaphragm delivers pleasing bokeh at all settings. Additional features include a durable all metal housing with a user-friendly grip, a removable and reversible for storage lens hood, and full compatibility with APS-C Sony E-mount cameras, where it will provide an equivalent focal length of approximately 52mm for a normal angle of view. The new Samyang 35mm F1.4 AF Full Frame lens for Sony E is designed to appeal to enthusiasts and professionals who are ready to take the next step up in wide angle photography where outstanding image clarity, contrast, color fidelity, high corner to corner resolution are priority.",

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Full frame lens with APS-C compatibility Stunning compression effect for portrait photography Ideal use: studio photography, portrait photography and event photography Introducing the ultimate 135mm telephoto featuring top-level performance Delivering the ultra-high resolution that brings the best out of 50MP+ ultra-high-megapixel DSLRs 135mm telephoto lenses are often categorized as the foundational telephoto, the first one to add to a lens collection. This focal length delivers a strong perspective compression effect, while the large diameter with F1.8 brightness provides a dramatic bokeh effect. By minimizing axial chromatic aberration, the SIGMA 135mm F1.8 DG HSM | Art makes this bokeh effect not only impressive but also beautiful while delivering superb contrast and sharp image quality in every shot. It offers the outstanding resolution required for 50MP or higher ultra-high-megapixel DSLRs. By incorporating its latest innovations in design and optical glass and rethinking every aspect of the lens, SIGMA has ensured outstanding image quality all the way to the edges, establishing the new standard in 135mm telephoto lenses. Optical design delivering ultra-high-resolution Optical design delivering ultra-high-resolution and minimized chromatic aberrations In addition to an optimized power distribution, this lens features two SLD (Super Low Dispersion) glass elements and two FLD (F Low Dispersion) glass elements. These technologies help minimize chromatic aberrations, which tend to appear in the bokeh area outside of focus in portraits, as well as on slender objects such as fine branches. The end result is ultra-high resolution and clarity throughout the image, even at wide-open aperture. Smooth bokeh and minimised flare. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. From an early stage in the lens design process, flare and ghosting have been measured to establish an optical design resistant to strong incident light sources such as backlighting. SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting to help photographers produce sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions. The included lens hood can be attached to block out extraneous light, which can have a negative effect on rendering performance. Outstanding resolving power Outstanding resolving power and minimized chromatic aberrations help make this the ultimate lens for portraits. With resolution so crystal-clear that individual hairs can be discerned in a portrait, this large-diameter lens also delivers a beautiful bokeh effect, giving photographers everything they need. It performs better than typical large-diameter standard to medium telephoto lenses in producing close-ups and full-body shots in which the subject stands out against a pleasantly blurred background. High-precision, rugged brass bayonet mount The brass mount combines high precision with rugged construction. Its treated surfaces and enhanced strength contribute to the exceptional durability of the lens. Compatible with full-frame Sony E-mount cameras The version of this lens compatible with Sony E-mount mirrorless cameras contains the same optical system as for SLRs. SIGMA MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11 is not required, as the lens performs the same functions as the converter, including in-camera image stabilization and in-camera lens aberration correction. In addition, the lens is compatible with Sonys Continuous AF, which is not addressed by MOUNT CONVERTER MC-11. SIGMA plans to offer over time Sony E-mount versions of every full-frame prime lens currently available in the Art line, from 14mm to 135mm.Note: This product is developed, manufactured and sold based on the specifications of E-mount which was disclosed by Sony Corporation under the license agreement with Sony Supplied Accessories LENS HOOD LH880-03 PADDED CASE FRONT CAP LCF  82mm REAR CAP LCR  *The lens hood cuts harmful rays that can negatively affect photographs while also minimizing reflectivity within the hood itself. The hood also features a rubber construction and a non-slip groove to make it easy to hold in a variety of shooting situations. SIGMA WR CERAMIC PROTECTOR 82mm (OPTIONAL) With many applications in aerospace and other industries, glass ceramic is an extremely tough type of crystallized glass that serves as the foundation for Clear Glass Ceramic. While featuring the high transmittance required of optical devices, this advanced new material combines greater hardness than chemically strengthened glass and greater flexibility than sapphire crystal glass. These qualities make Clear Glass Ceramic the ideal material for protective lens filters. Ultra-high precision and qualityall made in Japan. With only a few minor exceptions, all of SIGMA's manufacturing, including molds and parts, takes place under a single integrated production system in Japan. We are now one of the very few manufacturers whose products are truly made in Japan.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   Carl Zeiss mid-range zoom lens; Compatible with E-mount Full Frame cameras and E-mount APS-C cameras Minimum Focus Distance : 1.15 feet (0.35 m), Maximum Magnification ratio : 0.23x, Focal Length : 16-70 mm High lens technology in a compact body. Filter Diameter (mm) - 55 mm Optical Steady Shot image stabilization. Zeiss T anti-reflective coating When using a flash, always remove the lens hood and shoot at least 1 m (3.3 feet) away from your subject. Angle of View (APS-C): 83-23 Product Description Outstanding contrast and resolution throughout the image area at all zoom settings are the hallmark of this high-performance Carl Zeiss mid-range zoom lens The latest advances in optical design technology have made it possible to deliver prized Carl Zeiss contrast and clarity in a high-performance mid-range zoom. Four aspherical elements combine with one ED glass element to bring you breathtaking rendering. When changing your aperture to defocus the background, the light sources appear blurred. This bokeh effect of the blurred background can be enhanced with circular aperture blades used in this lens. Conventional aperture blades have flat sides creating unappealing polygonal shaped defocussed points of light.  lenses overcome this problem through a unique design that keeps the aperture almost perfectly circular from its wide-open setting to when it is closed by 2 stops. Smoother, more natural defocusing can be obtained as a result. As focal lengths get longer, lenses built with conventional optical glass have difficulties with chromatic aberration, and as a result images suffer from lower contrast, lower color quality, and lower resolution. ED glass dramatically reduces chromatic aberration at telephoto ranges, and provides superior contrast across the entire image, even at large aperture settings. Super ED glass provides enhanced compensation for chromatic aberration. Aspherical lens design dramatically reduces spherical aberration while also reducing lens size and weight. Spherical aberration is a slight misalignment of the light rays projected on the image plane. This is caused by differences in refraction at different points on conventional spherical lenses which degrade image quality in large-aperture lenses. Specially shaped aspherical elements near the diaphragm restore alignment of light rays at the image plane, maintaining high sharpness and contrast even at maximum aperture and can also be used at other points in the optical path to reduce distortion. Well-designed aspherical elements can reduce the total number of elements required in the lens, thus reducing overall size and weight. Advanced Aspherical (AA) elements are an evolved variant, featuring an extremely high thickness ratio between the center and periphery. AA elements are exceedingly difficult to produce, relying on the most advanced molding technology to consistently and precisely achieve the required shape and surface accuracy, resulting in significantly improved image accuracy and quality. Coated optics were pioneered by Carl Zeiss - and this superb lens features the Carl Zeiss T* (T-Star) coating that virtually eliminates lens flare, internal reflection and light scattering that can otherwise occur at glass-to-air surfaces. The T* coating contributes to outstanding image quality, with high contrast and uniformly excellent resolution right out to the image edges. Not simply applied to any lens - the T* symbol only appears on multi-element lenses in which the required performance has been achieved throughout the entire optical path, therefore guaranteeing the highest quality. Gyro sensors built into the lens detect even the slightest movement, and the stabilization lens is precisely shifted to counteract any image blur that might occur. The use of precision, quiet linear motors and technology inherited from high-end Sony professional camcorders results in exceptionally quiet, effective image stabilization that contributes to high-quality movies as well as stills. Only the middle groups of the optical system move to achieve focus, so the overall length of the lens does not change. Other important benefits include fast autofocusing and a short minimum focusing distance. Also, the filter thread at the front of the lens does not rotate, which is convenient if youre using a polarizing filter. 2013 Sony Electronics All rights reserved.

Controlled by SIGMAs latest algorithm, a newly developed coreless DC motor adjusts focus with optimal speed and low noise. Full-time manual focus is available even during autofocus, allowing the photographer to make minute focus adjustments simply by turning the focus ring. In addition, the focus rings large angle of rotation helps the photographer achieve the extremely precise focusing required for effective macro photography. Crop on image to the left \"This cropped image is straight from the camera and shows the dust inside the glass of the watch intact. The amount of detail that this lens can reproduce is tremendous!\" - Paul Monaghan professional photographer. Versatile As well as being a remarkable macro lens the 70mm F2.8 DG HSM | A is also highly versatile with a wide range of subjects and shooting conditions Made in Japan All Sigma products, lenses, cameras and flash units are manufactured exclusively by Sigma in Sigmas own factory in Aizu, Japan. No Sigma Corporation product  lens, camera or flash  is manufactured outside of Japan. This is very unusual these days, as most companies have at least some of their products produced outside of Japan because of cost considerations. There's a reason why SIGMA continues to insist on the very highest quality in its product manufacturing: our love of photography is second to none. We deeply appreciate the photographer's desire to record and expressthe passion of the photographer. We understand the need to capture the moment that gives rise to a unique work Top-level performance at every shooting distance In order to realize top-level performance at every shooting distance, the lens features an extending, floating, two-group focus mechanism. This configuration minimizes aberration to produce optimal results at any focus distance. To minimize axial chromatic aberration, the optical system incorporates two FLD glass elements, two SLD glass elements, and one element with a high rate of anomalous partial dispersion and a high index of refraction. In addition, two aspherical lens elements help increase resolution at close shooting distances. This optical system makes possible a razor-sharp in-focus area contrasted with a bokeh area free of color streaking. The mount features a special sealing to make the lens an excellent choice in a wide variety of conditions. Smooth bokeh and minimised flare. The 9-blade rounded diaphragm creates an attractive blur in the out-of-focus areas of the image. From an early stage in the lens design process, flare and ghosting have been measured to establish an optical design resistant to strong incident light sources such as backlighting. SIGMAs Super Multi-Layer Coating reduces flare and ghosting to help photographers produce sharp and high contrast images even in backlit conditions. The included lens hood can be attached to block out extraneous light, which can have a negative effect on rendering performance. High-precision, rugged brass bayonet mount The brass mount combines high precision with rugged construction. Its treated surfaces and enhanced strength contribute to the exceptional durability of the lens. SIGMA USB DOCK (Optional) By connecting a SIGMA 70mm F2.8 DG MACRO | Art lens to a computer with the OPTIONAL SIGMA USB DOCK, photographers can update the lens firmware and adjust focus position and other parameters. Exclusive SIGMA Optimization Pro software makes customization easy. It is possible to select the autofocus speed and adjust the focus limiter.

        "description": "  Make sure this fits  by entering your model number.   VERSATILE FULL-FRAME LENS: The powerful lens for the mirrorless full-frame system of Sony fulfills the highest requirements. Despite its compact design, the image meets the expectations of professional photographers. EXCELLENT RESOLUTION AND HIGH CONTRAST: Richly saturated and vivid colours are a must in the creation of lasting impressions. However, stray light within an optical system leads to a lightening of the image that is particularly noticeable in the shadows. This reduces image contrast, with the result that exposures lack contrast and appear faded. To avoid this, ZEISS combines various specially developed technologies to reduce the undesirable effects of stray light. ROBUST AND WEATHERPROOF METAL CONSTRUCTION: Thanks to features that are designed to keep out dust and spray water, the lens is perfectly suited for critical outdoor conditions. It is also designed for many years of intensive use. INNOVATIVE OLED DISPLAY: For the first time, you can accurately read the focus distance and depth of field simply and intuitively on the OLED display on the lens. Especially in poor light conditions - excellent readability is always guaranteed. SMOOTH AND RELIABLE AUTOFOCUS: The design of the autofocus system requires an extremely accurate shifting of particular lens groups. The focusing system of ZEISS lenses is designed to ensure a robust and smooth-running autofocus mechanism with the best imaging performance.
